# Changelog

## v1.18.0 — 2026-04-07

Sprint 41 small backlog sweep: Telegram notifications, byte-aware truncation fix, multi-provider parallel workers via `model:` spec annotation, tiktoken marked won't-fix.

### What's new

- **Telegram notification channel** — `sendTelegramNotification()` added to `notify.ts`. Configurable via `PHASE2S_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `PHASE2S_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` env vars or `notify.telegram` in `.phase2s.yaml`.
- **`phase2s init --telegram-setup` wizard** — interactive wizard that calls `getUpdates`, picks the most recent chat by `update_id`, prints the chat ID and ready-to-paste YAML snippet. Handles invalid tokens, empty results (up to 3 retries), and multiple chats.
- **`model:` spec annotation for parallel workers** — subtasks can declare `model: fast`, `model: smart`, or a literal model name. `resolveSubtaskModel()` maps aliases to configured tiers and falls back to the outer `--model` flag.
- **Byte-aware context truncation** — `level-context.ts` now uses `Buffer.from(context,'utf8').subarray(0,limit).toString('utf8')` instead of `String.slice()`. Fixes silent byte overrun with emoji or CJK filenames.

### Fixed

- `level-context.ts` truncation used JS string code units, not bytes. Emoji filenames could push output past `MAX_CONTEXT_BYTES`.

### Closed as wont-fix

- `conversation.ts` token estimation: errs conservatively (safe direction). 2MB wasm dep not worth marginal precision gain.

### Tests

820 → 850 (30 new tests across `level-context`, `notify`, `spec-parser`, and `parallel-executor`).


## v1.17.0 — 2026-04-07

Test hygiene: `level-context.test.ts` is now fully isolated — all tests run against temp repos instead of the live project repo. TODOS.md housekeeping.

### Changed

- **`level-context.test.ts` fully isolated** — all 6 tests now use `withTempRepo()` instead of `process.cwd()`. The two describe blocks are consolidated into one. No live-repo dependency remains in the file. Test count: 821 → 820 (one duplicate HEAD-equals-HEAD test removed during consolidation).
- **TODOS.md housekeeping** — orchestrator auto-detect warning marked complete (was shipped in v1.15.0 but left open); `level-context.test.ts` migration marked complete.

## v1.16.0 — 2026-04-06

Live re-planning after subtask failure, structured architect context JSON, and path-traversal hardening for LLM-generated job IDs.

### What's new

- **Live re-planning** — when a subtask fails, the orchestrator calls the LLM with a structured prompt describing the failure, remaining jobs, and architect context. The revised plan (a `delta` of new or updated jobs) is validated with 2 retries, merged back, and re-leveled — execution continues rather than stopping. New jobs added by the LLM are registered immediately so skip-sync and downstream DFS see them.
- **Validated LLM output (`schemaGate<T>`)** — new `src/core/schema-gate.ts` utility. Extracts JSON from the LLM response, validates it with a type predicate, and retries up to N times with the previous error injected. The re-planner uses this to get a structurally valid delta before accepting it.
- **Structured architect context** — architect workers now emit a ` ```context-json ` block with a typed JSON summary of their design decisions. `parseArchitectContext()` extracts and validates the block. The re-planner receives a structured `ArchitectContext` object instead of freeform text, making re-plan prompts more reliable.
- **`context-json` sentinel replaces `<!-- CONTEXT -->`** — all role prompts updated. Backward-compatible: the old sentinel still works for downstream file injection.
- **Backward contamination flagging** — after re-planning, the orchestrator walks backward from the failed job through completed ancestors (DFS) and flags them as `suspect`. Suspect count is logged to `orchestrator_replan_result.suspectCount` and returned in the final result. Useful for post-run audits when a failure may have consumed unreliable upstream output.
- **`filteredCompletedCount` on re-plan result** — `orchestrator_replan_result` now includes `filteredCompletedCount: number` (how many completed IDs the model included in delta, filtered server-side). Replaces a misleading `orchestrator_replan_failed` event that was previously emitted for this case.
- **Named re-plan constants** — `REPLAN_REMAINING_SHOWN_JOBS = 5` and `REPLAN_SCHEMA_GATE_RETRIES = 2` replace magic numbers.

### Security

- **`isDeltaResponse` slug validation** — delta job `id` fields are now validated against `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$/` before acceptance. LLM-generated IDs containing `../`, absolute paths, or spaces are rejected, preventing path traversal when the ID is used in context file construction.
- **`dependsOn` element typing** — `isDeltaResponse` now validates that every element of `dependsOn` is a `string` (previously only checked `Array.isArray`).

### Fixed

- `allJobs` staleness — orchestrator now uses `[...jobById.values()]` instead of the original `allJobs` parameter for DFS, skip-sync, and remaining-pending filtering. Delta-added jobs are visible to all post-re-plan operations.
- Dead `orchestrator_replan` event removed from `RunEvent` union (replaced by `orchestrator_replan_result` and `orchestrator_replan_failed`).
- `OrchestratorResult` and `orchestrator_completed` now include `suspectCount`.

### Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| New source files | 2 (`schema-gate.ts`, `architect-context.ts`) |
| New test files | 2 (`replan.test.ts`, `types.test.ts`) |

## v1.15.0 — 2026-04-06

Multi-agent orchestrator: role-aware spec compilation, deterministic state machine routing, and architect context passing.

### What's new

- **Multi-Agent Orchestrator** — new `src/orchestrator/` module routes subtasks to role-appropriate workers (architect, implementer, tester, reviewer). Each role gets a tailored system prompt. The orchestrator is a deterministic state machine, not an LLM.
- **Role annotations in specs** — add `**Role:** architect` (or `implementer`, `tester`, `reviewer`) to any subtask body. `phase2s goal` auto-detects role annotations and activates orchestrator mode. Use `--orchestrator` to force it regardless.
- **Architect context passing** — architect workers emit a `<!-- CONTEXT -->` sentinel in their output. The orchestrator extracts the content, caps it at 4096 bytes, and injects it into downstream workers' system prompts as `Prior context from upstream subtask '...'`. Missing sentinel triggers an `orchestrator_context_missing` log event.
- **Transitive failure skipping** — when a job fails, DFS traversal marks all transitively dependent jobs as `skipped`. Independent subtasks are unaffected. `replanOnFailure()` stub logs `orchestrator_replan` event (Sprint 39: LLM call).
- **`phase2s goal --orchestrator`** — explicit flag to activate orchestrator mode on any spec, even without role annotations (all jobs default to `implementer`).
- **6 new run-log events** — `orchestrator_started`, `job_promoted`, `job_routed`, `orchestrator_context_missing`, `orchestrator_replan`, `orchestrator_completed` in the JSONL run log.
- **Backward compatible** — specs without `**Role:**` annotations run exactly as v1.14.0. Orchestrator only activates when annotations are present or `--orchestrator` is passed.
- **59 new tests** — spec-compiler (16), role-prompts (5), orchestrator (26), plus role parsing in spec-parser (7) and executeOrchestratorLevel in parallel-executor (5). Total: 761.

### Fixed

- Shell injection hardening in `executeOrchestratorLevel` — `git add -A` and `git diff --cached --quiet` now use `execFileSync` array form alongside the existing `git commit` call. No shell-expanded paths.
- UTF-8 multibyte boundary safe truncation — context content truncated with `Buffer.slice()` instead of `String.slice()` to avoid splitting codepoints.
- DFS cycle guard — `computeSkippedIds` uses a visited set to prevent infinite loop on invariant-violating `dependsOn` cycles.
- `symlinkNodeModules` errors in orchestrator workers now return `status: 'failed'` instead of rejecting the whole `Promise.all`.
- `mkdtempSync` for context temp dir — replaced deterministic `tmpdir/phase2s-context-<hash>-<timestamp>` with `mkdtempSync` to prevent concurrent process collision on the same spec.
- Orchestrator context path uses `job.id` (safe slug) instead of `result.subtaskId` (caller-supplied via injected `executeLevelFn`) — closes a theoretical path traversal vector in the context file name.
- `activeJobs` filter now also excludes `failed` and `completed` jobs in addition to `skipped` — defensive guard against re-running jobs on resume or unexpected level replay.
- Removed unnecessary `CONTEXT_SENTINEL` alias — `ARCHITECT_CONTEXT_SENTINEL` from `role-prompts.ts` is the single source of truth and is now used directly in the orchestrator.
- `slugify()` fallback — returns `'subtask'` for names that produce an empty slug (e.g. `"---"`), preventing empty-string `job.id` collisions in the `jobById` map.
- Worker timeout message — now emits `"Worker timeout after Xs"` consistent with `executeWorker`, making run logs grep-consistent.
- `goal_completed` log event — `success` field now uses `totalFailed === 0 && totalSkipped === 0`, matching `GoalResult.success`. Previous: log said success even when subtasks were skipped.
- Total system prompt cap — `job.systemPromptPrefix` is now capped at 16 KB across all injected upstream context chunks (each chunk was already capped at 4 KB, but accumulation was unbounded).

## v1.14.0 — 2026-04-06

Score your spec against the diff, and three bug fixes for parallel dark factory runs.

### What's new

- **Spec Eval Judge** — reads your spec's acceptance criteria, compares them against a git diff, and produces a per-criterion coverage map with a derived 0-10 score (`src/eval/judge.ts`). Score formula: `(met×1.0 + partial×0.5) / total × 10`. Never throws, returns `score: null` on any failure. Diff truncated at 40,000 chars to stay within model context.
- **`phase2s judge <spec.md> --diff <file>`** — Standalone CLI subcommand. Prints a JUDGE REPORT block to stdout. Exits 1 if score < 7 (for CI integration). Also accepts diff via stdin: `git diff HEAD~1 | phase2s judge spec.md`.
- **`phase2s goal --judge`** — Runs the judge automatically after each attempt. Captures `baseRef` before any agent execution, computes `git diff baseRef..HEAD`, calls `judgeRun`, and logs an `eval_judged` JSONL event.
- **`eval_judged` event in run logs** — New event type in `RunEvent` union: `score`, `verdict`, `criteria[]`, `diffStats`. Rendered as a JUDGE REPORT block by `phase2s report`.
- **Fix: timer leak in `executeWorker()`** — `clearTimeout(timeoutHandle)` now always called in `finally` block. Previous: successful workers left a live 10-minute timer, delaying `process.exit` in CI.
- **Fix: `unstash()` popping wrong stash entry** — Now uses named stash (`git stash push --message "phase2s-<runId>"`) and pops by ref (`stash@{N}`) instead of always popping `stash@{0}`. User's pre-existing stash entries are never touched.
- **Fix: concurrent `git worktree prune` race** — Promise-chain mutex (`Map<string, Promise<void>>`) serializes prune+add per repo. Multiple workers racing on the same repo no longer cause one to fail with "worktree already exists".

## v1.13.0 — 2026-04-05

Integration test coverage for the parallel infrastructure + `--resume --parallel` hardening.

### What's new

- **`--resume --parallel` now works reliably** — `makeWorktreeSlug()` is now deterministic (`ph2s-<specHash8>-<index>` instead of a random suffix). Worktree paths are written to state on creation, so a resumed run finds existing worktrees instead of creating new ones with different names.
- **Shared integration test harness** (`test/goal/helpers.ts`) — `makeTempRepo()`, `commitFile()`, `commitManyFiles()`, `makeConflictingBranches()`, `withTempRepo()`. Real git repos, not mocked `execSync`. All future parallel test suites get these helpers for free.
- **`executeParallel()` behavior tests** — timeout rejection, level failure halts, `completedLevels` skip on resume, `unstash` called in finally.
- **`mergeWorktree()` conflict detection tests** — two branches modifying the same file → `status: "conflict"` + `conflictFiles`, `git merge --abort` restores clean state.
- **`stashIfDirty` / `unstash` integration tests** — dirty tracked file → stash created, clean tree → no stash, unstash restores content, unstash on clean tree is a no-op.
- **`buildLevelContext()` real-repo tests** — filename + "files changed" in output, truncation at 4096 bytes with `(truncated)` marker, empty diff returns `""`.
- **`updateWorkerPane` / `updateStatusBar` tests** — inactive dashboard no-throw, double-quote escaping verification.

### Upgrade note

In-progress `phase2s goal --parallel` runs from v1.12.0 are not resumable across this upgrade. Worktree slugs changed from random to deterministic — a v1.12.0 state file references slugs that no longer match. Restart interrupted runs from scratch after upgrading.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-04-05

Parallel dark factory execution. Spec-aware parallelism with dependency analysis, git worktrees, and optional tmux dashboard.

### What's new

- **Parallel execution** — `phase2s goal --parallel spec.md` or auto-detected when 3+ independent subtasks. Subtasks run in parallel inside git worktrees, merged at level boundaries. Max 3 default workers (`--workers N` to override, 1-8 range).
- **Dependency graph** — Hybrid file-reference detection: explicit `files:` annotation in spec (highest priority) or regex heuristic from subtask descriptions. Kahn's algorithm for topological sort with cycle detection.
- **Auto-detect** — When a spec has 3+ independent subtasks, parallel mode is enabled automatically. Use `--sequential` to force sequential mode.
- **Dry-run visualization** — `phase2s goal --parallel --dry-run spec.md` shows the execution plan as an ASCII diagram with levels and dependencies.
- **Level context injection** — Each parallel worker receives a git diff summary of what prior levels changed, compensating for the loss of shared conversation history.
- **Merge conflict detection** — Same-file conflicts halt the pipeline with clear error reporting. Different-file changes merge cleanly.
- **tmux dashboard** (optional) — `--dashboard` flag shows live progress per worker in tmux panes.
- **Parallel run reports** — `phase2s report` shows per-level timing, merge timing, and wall-clock savings vs sequential estimate.
- **Resume** — `--resume --parallel` resumes from the last completed level.
- **Doctor checks** — `phase2s doctor` now checks for tmux and git worktree support.

### Spec format addition

Subtasks can now include an optional `**Files:**` annotation for explicit dependency declaration:

```markdown
### Sub-task 1: Create API routes
- **Input:** API spec
- **Output:** Route handlers
- **Success criteria:** Tests pass
- **Files:** src/api/routes.ts, src/api/middleware.ts
```

When present, `files:` overrides the regex heuristic for dependency analysis.

## v1.11.0 — 2026-04-05

MiniMax provider + README refresh (bear mascot removed).

### What's new

- **MiniMax provider** — `provider: minimax` in `.phase2s.yaml` (or `PHASE2S_PROVIDER=minimax`). Connects to MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible API at `api.minimax.io/v1/`. Default model `MiniMax-M2.5`. Set `MINIMAX_API_KEY` or `minimaxApiKey` in config. `phase2s init` wizard option 7 and `phase2s doctor` both handle MiniMax. 7 providers total.
- **README refresh** — Providers comparison table. Features in Depth section covering: `phase2s lint`, `--dry-run`, live progress display, `phase2s report`, MCP state server, MCP report tool, headless browser, `--system` flag, `verifyCommand` config.

### Removed

- Bear mascot (shipped in v1.10.0, removed in v1.11.0). The ASCII art didn't meet the quality bar.

### Usage

```bash
# Bear greets you at startup (disable with --no-banner or bear: false in config)
phase2s
phase2s --no-banner

# MiniMax provider
export MINIMAX_API_KEY="your-key"
phase2s init  # choose option 7
```

## v1.9.0 — 2026-04-05

Dark factory visibility: dry-run mode, live progress, and richer lint checks.

### What's new

- **`phase2s goal <spec.md> --dry-run`** — parse and display the spec decomposition tree without making a single LLM call. Prints the spec title, eval command, sub-task list (with inputs, outputs, and success criteria), and acceptance criteria. Exits in under a second. Useful before committing to a 20-minute dark-factory run. 3 tests.
- **Live progress display** — the dark factory now shows `[1/3] Running: Sub-task name` (cyan) or `[1/3] Retrying: Sub-task name` (yellow) as each sub-task starts, and `Done in Xs` when it finishes. Skipped sub-tasks (passed in a prior attempt) are shown in dim. Makes it clear where you are in a long run.
- **`phase2s lint`: >8 sub-task warning** — if your spec has more than 8 sub-tasks, lint warns. Large specs are unreliable; retry combinatorics grow fast. Break into multiple smaller specs and run sequentially. 1 test.
- **`phase2s lint`: evalCommand PATH check** — if your spec specifies an eval command (e.g., `pytest tests/`) and the binary isn't on PATH, lint warns immediately instead of failing 20 minutes into a run. Skipped for the default `npm test` (most machines have npm). 3 tests.

### Usage

```bash
# Preview what a dark-factory run would do
phase2s goal specs/add-rate-limiting.md --dry-run

# Validate + preview before committing to a long run
phase2s lint specs/add-rate-limiting.md && phase2s goal specs/add-rate-limiting.md --dry-run

# Run with live progress
phase2s goal specs/add-rate-limiting.md
# [1/2] Running: Token bucket core
# Done in 8s
# [2/2] Running: Express middleware
# Done in 11s
```

## v1.8.0 — 2026-04-05

Spec linting + Google Gemini provider.

### What's new

- **`phase2s lint <spec.md>`** — validates a 5-pillar spec file before you commit 20 minutes to a dark-factory run. Catches 4 structural errors (missing title, empty problem statement, no decomposition sub-tasks, no acceptance criteria) and 2 advisory warnings (default evalCommand still set to `npm test`, subtask missing success criteria). Exits 0 when the spec is runnable (warnings OK), exits 1 on errors. Designed to integrate into CI before `phase2s goal`. 8 tests.
- **Gemini provider** — `provider: gemini` in `.phase2s.yaml` (or `PHASE2S_PROVIDER=gemini` env var). Connects to Google's OpenAI-compatible API at `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` — no new SDK dependency. Default model `gemini-2.0-flash`. Free tier available. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (starts with `AIza`) or `geminiApiKey` in config. Optional `geminiBaseUrl` override. `phase2s init` wizard option 6 and `phase2s doctor` both handle Gemini. 5 tests.

### Usage

```bash
# Validate a spec before running it
phase2s lint specs/add-rate-limiting.md

# Run only after lint passes
phase2s lint specs/add-rate-limiting.md && phase2s goal specs/add-rate-limiting.md

# Configure Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
phase2s init  # choose option 6
# or in .phase2s.yaml:
# provider: gemini
# model: gemini-2.5-pro   # upgrade from the default gemini-2.0-flash
```

---

## v1.7.0 — 2026-04-05

Self-update command + skills search.

### What's new

- **`phase2s upgrade`** — checks npm registry for the latest version and offers to install it. Runs `npm install -g @scanton/phase2s` with live output when you say yes. `--check` flag for CI / non-interactive use (reports whether an update is available without prompting). Fails gracefully if the registry is unreachable. 12 tests.
- **`phase2s skills [query]`** — optional search query on the `skills` command. Filters by skill name and description (case-insensitive substring match). `phase2s skills quality` returns `/health`, `/qa`, `/audit`. `phase2s skills ship` returns `/ship` and `/land-and-deploy`. Works with `--json` for scripting. When no skills match, prints a helpful message pointing back to `phase2s skills` for the full list. Fully backward compatible — no args still lists all skills. 7 tests.

### Usage

```bash
# Check for updates and upgrade
phase2s upgrade

# Just check without prompting (CI-friendly)
phase2s upgrade --check

# Find skills related to a topic
phase2s skills quality
phase2s skills security
phase2s skills deploy
phase2s skills search    # try partial names too

# JSON output with filter (for scripts)
phase2s skills --json security
```

## v1.6.0 — 2026-04-05

Installation health check + OpenRouter provider.

### What's new

- **`phase2s doctor`** — new diagnostic command that runs 5 health checks and tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. Checks Node.js version (>= 20), provider binary availability (codex, ollama), API key / auth state for all providers, `.phase2s.yaml` validity, and `.phase2s/` working directory writability. Prints `✓`/`✗` per check with one-line fix instructions. Exits with a summary: "All checks passed" or "N issues found."
- **OpenRouter provider** — `provider: openrouter` in `.phase2s.yaml` (or `PHASE2S_PROVIDER=openrouter` env var). Routes requests through [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) to 50+ models under a single API key. Model names use provider-prefixed slugs: `openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet`, `google/gemini-pro-1.5`. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `openrouterApiKey` in config. Optional `openrouterBaseUrl` for custom deployments. `phase2s init` wizard supports OpenRouter setup with prerequisite check and next-steps guidance.

### Usage

```bash
# Run the health check
phase2s doctor

# OpenRouter via env vars
export PHASE2S_PROVIDER=openrouter
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
phase2s run "explain this file"

# OpenRouter with a specific model
phase2s -m anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet run "review src/core/agent.ts"

# Set up interactively
phase2s init
# (select OpenRouter when prompted for provider)
```

```yaml
# .phase2s.yaml — OpenRouter config
provider: openrouter
openrouterApiKey: "sk-or-..."
model: "openai/gpt-4o"        # any OpenRouter model slug
fast_model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
smart_model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet"
```

---

## v1.5.0 — 2026-04-05

Notification channels expansion + glob tool filtering.

### What's new

- **Discord notifications** — `notify.discord` in `.phase2s.yaml` or `PHASE2S_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` env var. Rich embeds with green/red color coding for success/failure. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Microsoft Teams notifications** — `notify.teams` in `.phase2s.yaml` or `PHASE2S_TEAMS_WEBHOOK` env var. MessageCard format with color-coded `themeColor`. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **`phase2s init` wizard** — two new prompts for Discord and Teams webhook URLs. Pre-fills from existing config. `--discord-webhook` and `--teams-webhook` flags for non-interactive CI mode.
- **Glob pattern matching in `tools` and `deny`** — `*` is now a wildcard in the tool allow/deny lists. `tools: ["file_*"]` allows `file_read` and `file_write` without listing them individually. `deny: ["*"]` blocks everything. Patterns that match no known tool produce a startup warning. Exact names still work as before — fully backward compatible.

### Usage

```bash
# Discord via env var
export PHASE2S_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
phase2s goal my-spec.md --notify

# Teams via env var
export PHASE2S_TEAMS_WEBHOOK=https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...
phase2s goal my-spec.md --notify

# Set up interactively
phase2s init

# Non-interactive CI setup
phase2s init --non-interactive --provider codex-cli \
  --slack-webhook https://hooks.slack.com/... \
  --discord-webhook https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... \
  --teams-webhook https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...
```

```yaml
# .phase2s.yaml — glob tool filtering
tools:
  - file_*   # file_read + file_write
  - glob
  - grep
# shell is not listed, so it's blocked
```

### Tests

516 passing (was 503, +13 new tests):
- `test/core/registry.test.ts` — +5 glob matching tests: `file_*` allow, `*` allow-all, `file_*` deny, deny-overrides-allow with globs, no-match warns
- `test/core/notify.test.ts` — +6 notification tests: Discord embed payload, Discord success/failure color, Teams MessageCard payload, Teams success/failure color, no-channel warning mentions all three env vars
- `test/cli/init.test.ts` — +3 init tests: `discordWebhook` in formatConfig, `teamsWebhook` in formatConfig, all three webhooks together

---

## v1.4.0 — 2026-04-05

Interactive onboarding wizard — get from zero to configured in under 60 seconds.

### What's new

- **`phase2s init`** — interactive setup wizard that writes `.phase2s.yaml` for you. Asks up to 4 questions: provider choice (codex-cli / openai-api / anthropic / ollama), API key, optional fast/smart model tiers, optional Slack webhook. Pre-fills from an existing config file if one exists. Validates prerequisites (checks binaries, key formats) and prints tailored next steps per provider.
- **Non-interactive mode** — `phase2s init --non-interactive --provider openai-api --api-key sk-...` for CI scripting and automated setup. Zero prompts.
- **Existing config pre-fill** — if `.phase2s.yaml` already exists, all prompts default to the current values. Rerunning `init` is safe — it's an update wizard, not just a first-run tool.
- **Prerequisite validation** — checks that `codex` is on PATH (codex-cli provider), validates API key prefix format (`sk-` for OpenAI, `sk-ant-` for Anthropic), checks that `ollama` is on PATH (ollama provider). Reports warnings post-write so the config is always saved even if setup isn't complete.

### Usage

```bash
# Interactive (recommended for first-time setup)
phase2s init

# Non-interactive (CI / automation)
phase2s init --non-interactive --provider openai-api --api-key sk-your-key
phase2s init --non-interactive --provider anthropic --api-key sk-ant-your-key
phase2s init --non-interactive --provider codex-cli --fast-model gpt-4o-mini --smart-model o3
```

### Tests

503 passing (was 483, +20 new tests):
- `test/cli/init.test.ts` (new) — 20 tests covering `formatConfig` (all 4 providers, model tiers, Slack block), `checkPrerequisites` (binary detection, API key format validation, missing key warnings), `readExistingConfig` (parse, missing file, invalid YAML, non-object YAML)

---

## v1.3.0 — 2026-04-05

Notification gateway + run report viewer — complete the fire-and-forget story for the dark factory.

### What's new

- **`phase2s goal --notify`** — after a dark factory run completes (success, failure, or challenged), send a notification. macOS system notification via `osascript` (no new deps). Optional Slack webhook via `PHASE2S_SLACK_WEBHOOK` env var or `notify.slack` in `.phase2s.yaml`. Both channels are fail-safe: errors go to stderr and never block the run.
- **`phase2s report <logfile.jsonl>`** — parse and display a chalk-colored summary of a dark factory run log: spec filename, per-attempt sub-task timeline with durations (✓/✗), eval command, criteria verdicts, and total run time. Pass the path printed by `phase2s goal` as `Run log:`.
- **`phase2s__report` MCP tool** — same report viewer exposed as an MCP tool. After Claude Code triggers `phase2s__goal`, it can call `phase2s__report` with the returned `runLogPath` to see exactly what happened.
- **`GoalResult.durationMs`** — total wall-clock run duration now included in all goal results. Used by notifications and available to MCP callers.
- **`notify` config block** — `.phase2s.yaml` accepts `notify: { mac: true, slack: "https://hooks.slack.com/..." }`. The `--notify` CLI flag enables the configured channels. `PHASE2S_SLACK_WEBHOOK` env var provides the Slack URL without config file changes.

### Usage

```bash
# Run a spec with notifications enabled
phase2s goal my-spec.md --notify --review-before-run

# View a run log
phase2s report .phase2s/runs/2026-04-05T10-30-00-a3f1b2c4.jsonl

# Slack webhook via env var
PHASE2S_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/... phase2s goal spec.md --notify
```

```yaml
# .phase2s.yaml
notify:
  mac: true
  slack: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
```

### Tests

483 passing (was 453, +30 new tests):
- `test/core/notify.test.ts` (new) — 11 tests covering buildNotifyPayload variants, formatDurationMs, sendNotification no-op, osascript call, Slack fetch payload, error handling
- `test/cli/report.test.ts` (new) — 11 tests covering parseRunLog, buildRunReport (sub-task durations, criteria, challenged, error), formatRunReport (success, failure, challenged)
- `test/mcp/server.test.ts` — 4 new tests: REPORT_TOOL in tools/list, required logFile, empty logFile error, valid logFile returns report

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-05

Dark factory as MCP tool — run logs + pre-execution adversarial review.

### What's new

- **`phase2s__goal` MCP tool** — Claude Code can now trigger the dark factory directly. Call `phase2s__goal` with a spec file path and get back the run summary + an absolute path to the structured JSONL run log. No terminal required. Long-running by design (20+ min); the MCP 2024-11-05 spec has no timeout requirement at the transport level.
- **Structured JSONL run logs** — every dark factory run now writes a log to `<specDir>/.phase2s/runs/<timestamp>-<hash>.jsonl`. One event per line: `goal_started`, `subtask_started/completed`, `eval_started/completed`, `criteria_checked`, `goal_completed`. Claude can read it with `file_read` to see exactly what happened at each sub-task without guessing.
- **Pre-execution adversarial review** — `phase2s__goal` accepts `reviewBeforeRun: true` (and `phase2s goal --review-before-run` on the CLI). Before a single line of code is written, the spec is challenged by a fresh GPT agent using the adversarial SKILL.md template. `CHALLENGED` or `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` → halts and returns the full challenge response. `APPROVED` → proceeds. The review agent is a fresh `Agent` instance (not the satori implementation agent) to prevent context contamination.
- **`runGoal()` no longer calls `process.exit()`** — it throws `Error` on failure instead. The CLI entry point in `index.ts` wraps it in try/catch and calls `process.exit()` there. `runGoal()` is now a proper function that can be called from both CLI and MCP without leaking process lifecycle.
- **`GoalResult` extended** — `runLogPath: string`, `summary: string`, `challenged?: boolean`, `challengeResponse?: string` added. CLI prints `Run log: <path>` on exit.

### Behavior details

- Run logs live at `<specDir>/.phase2s/runs/<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>-<hash.slice(0,8)>.jsonl` relative to the spec file directory.
- Log writes are synchronous and throw on failure (never silently dropped).
- `reviewBeforeRun` is opt-in (default false). Quick iteration cycles are not slowed down.
- `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` is treated identically to `CHALLENGED` — both halt execution and set `challenged: true`.
- The `phase2s__goal` MCP response includes the absolute run log path so Claude can call `file_read` directly without guessing cwd.
- `buildAdversarialPrompt()` injects the spec's decomposition names + acceptance criteria as the "plan" to challenge, then appends the adversarial SKILL.md template.

### Tests

453 passing (was 433, +20 new tests):
- `test/core/run-logger.test.ts` (new) — 10 tests covering RunLogger lazy init, JSONL format, close() path, filename format, throw on write failure
- `test/cli/goal.test.ts` — 6 new tests: missing spec throws Error, buildAdversarialPrompt content, CHALLENGED halts run, NEEDS_CLARIFICATION halts run
- `test/mcp/server.test.ts` — 3 new tests: GOAL_TOOL in tools/list, required specFile, empty specFile returns error

## v1.1.0 — 2026-04-05

MCP state server + dark factory resumability.

### What's new

- **`phase2s goal --resume <spec.md>`** — resume a goal run from the last completed sub-task after interruption, crash, or non-retriable failure. State is written atomically after each sub-task completes or fails. Keyed by SHA-256 of spec file content (not path) so renamed specs resume cleanly and modified specs don't resume stale state.
- **MCP state tools** — three new tools available in every Phase2S MCP session:
  - `phase2s__state_write(key, value)` — write any JSON-serializable value to `.phase2s/state/<key>.json`
  - `phase2s__state_read(key)` — read a stored value, returns `null` if not found
  - `phase2s__state_clear(key)` — delete a stored value, no-op if not found
- **`src/core/state.ts`** — pure state functions shared by goal.ts and server.ts. Atomic writes via tmp-file + rename pattern.
- **Tests:** 433 passing (was 399, +34 new tests covering state.ts, goal resume behavior, MCP state tool round-trips).

### Behavior details

- State lives at `.phase2s/state/<hash>.json` relative to the **spec file directory** (not invocation cwd).
- `phase2s goal --resume spec.md` with no existing state: starts fresh silently. No error, no warning.
- Concurrent runs against the same spec: last-writer-wins. Documented constraint, no file locking.
- Sub-tasks interrupted mid-execution (process killed during satori): treated as not started on resume, retried from the beginning.
- On clean completion (all criteria pass): state is cleared automatically.
- `failureContext`: last 4096 bytes of satori output captured for failed sub-tasks, injected as prior failure context on resume.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-05

Feature complete. Full QA pass. Zero open roadmap items.

### What changed from v0.26.0

- **Security:** Updated `@actions/core` (v3), `@actions/github` (v9), and transitive `@actions/http-client` (v4) to resolve 3 CVEs in `undici` (1 high, 2 moderate). Action bundle rebuilt.
- **Docs: `advanced.md`** corrected — no longer claims Codex CLI can't stream. Codex now shows step-by-step messages for multi-step tasks (since v0.26.0).
- **Docs: version strings** updated in `getting-started.md`, `memory.md`, `workflows.md` example output blocks.
- **Docs: `PHASE2S_BROWSER`** environment variable added to `configuration.md`.
- **`package.json`:** Added `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `author` fields for npm page. Expanded keywords to include `anthropic`, `claude`, `chatgpt`, `mcp`, `coding-assistant`, `dark-factory`.
- **README:** Roadmap test count corrected (389 → 399).

### Stability contract

What is stable at v1.0.0 and will not break without a major version bump:

| Surface | Stable? | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `phase2s` CLI commands (`chat`, `run`, `mcp`, `skills`, `goal`, `completion`) | ✓ | Command names, flag names, exit codes |
| `phase2s run "/skillname args"` routing | ✓ | Skill routing in one-shot mode |
| `phase2s run --dry-run` | ✓ | |
| `phase2s goal <spec.md>` | ✓ | Spec format, `--max-attempts` flag |
| `.phase2s.yaml` config keys | ✓ | All documented keys in `docs/configuration.md` |
| Environment variables (`PHASE2S_*`) | ✓ | All documented in `docs/configuration.md` |
| SKILL.md frontmatter format | ✓ | `name`, `description`, `model`, `triggers`, `inputs` fields |
| MCP tool names (`phase2s__<skill_name>`) | ✓ | Naming convention stable |
| Session file format (`.phase2s/sessions/*.json`) | ✓ | Forward-compatible |
| Learnings file format (`.phase2s/memory/learnings.jsonl`) | ✓ | Append-only JSONL |
| Provider interface (`chatStream` async iterable) | internal | Not a public API — can change in minor versions |
| `ProviderEvent` types | internal | Not a public API |

### What "stable" means

- **CLI:** No flags renamed or removed without a deprecation period.
- **Config:** No keys renamed without a migration path.
- **SKILL.md:** Skills written for v1.0.0 will continue to load and run.
- **MCP tools:** Existing `phase2s__*` tool names will continue to exist. New tools may be added.
- **Breaking changes** (when they happen) get a major version bump and a migration note in CHANGELOG.

## v0.26.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 22: Real Codex streaming — JSONL stdout parsing replaces the `--output-last-message` temp file approach.

### What changed

- **Real-time step-by-step feedback** — For multi-step Codex tasks (where Codex runs shell commands between messages), each intermediate `agent_message` is now yielded immediately as it arrives. Previously all output was held until the entire run finished. With `/satori` or `phase2s goal` running a long spec, you now see progress live instead of waiting for the final message.

- **Temp file machinery removed** — `--output-last-message`, `mkdtemp`, `activeTempDirs`, `cleanupTempDirs`, and the SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handlers are all gone. The provider is ~70 lines shorter and has no filesystem side effects.

- **Silent JSONL fallback** — Malformed JSONL lines are silently skipped. If a Codex CLI version changes its event format, Phase2S degrades gracefully rather than crashing.

- **Error events surface cleanly** — `{"type":"error","message":"..."}` events from the Codex JSONL stream now throw immediately with the error message, rather than waiting for a non-zero exit code.

- **399 tests** — up from 389 (+10: JSONL streaming unit tests, updated hardening tests).

### JSONL event format (documented via spike)

```json
{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"..."}
{"type":"turn.started"}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"type":"agent_message","text":"Running that now."}}
{"type":"item.started","item":{"type":"command_execution","command":"npm test",...}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"type":"command_execution","command":"npm test","exit_code":0,...}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"type":"agent_message","text":"All 23 tests pass."}}
{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{"input_tokens":500,"output_tokens":20}}
```

Only `item.completed` events with `type: "agent_message"` produce output. `command_execution` items are consumed silently (Codex runs the command and we see the result in the next agent_message).

---

## v0.25.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 21: Dark Factory v1 — `phase2s goal <spec.md>` executes a spec autonomously using your ChatGPT subscription.

### What you can do now

- **`phase2s goal <spec.md>`** — give Phase2S a spec file and have it run to completion. It reads your spec, executes each sub-task through `/satori` (implement + test + retry), runs your eval command, checks acceptance criteria, and retries failing sub-tasks with failure context. Stops when all criteria pass or max attempts are exhausted. No manual intervention during the loop.
- **`--max-attempts <n>`** — control how many outer retry loops the executor runs (default: 3). Combined with satori's inner retries (3x per sub-task), a single spec execution can drive up to 9 implementation passes per sub-task.
- **5-pillar spec format** — `/deep-specify` now outputs the structured 5-pillar format (Problem Statement, Acceptance Criteria, Constraint Architecture, Decomposition, Evaluation Design) saved to `.phase2s/specs/`. Any spec produced by `/deep-specify` is directly consumable by `phase2s goal` with no manual editing.
- **Adversarial routing fixed** — CLAUDE.md now explicitly prohibits falling back to `codex exec` for adversarial review. `phase2s__adversarial` is always the correct tool. Codex CLI requires browser OAuth and fails silently in automated contexts.
- **389 tests** — up from 365 (+24: spec parser, goal executor helpers, and runCommand).

### Example

```bash
# Write a spec
phase2s
you > /deep-specify add pagination to the search endpoint

# Execute it autonomously (uses your ChatGPT subscription)
phase2s goal .phase2s/specs/2026-04-04-11-00-pagination.md
```

```
Goal executor: Pagination for search endpoint
Eval command: npm test
Sub-tasks: 3
Max attempts: 3

=== Attempt 1/3 ===
Running sub-task: Cursor-based pagination logic
...
Running evaluation: npm test
  ✗ Returns correct next_cursor on paginated results
  ✓ Returns 20 items per page by default

Retrying 1 sub-task(s): Cursor-based pagination logic

=== Attempt 2/3 ===
Running sub-task: Cursor-based pagination logic
...
Running evaluation: npm test
  ✓ Returns correct next_cursor on paginated results
  ✓ Returns 20 items per page by default

✓ All acceptance criteria met after 2 attempt(s).
```

## v0.24.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 20: published GitHub Action — `uses: scanton/phase2s@v1`.

### What you can do now

- **GitHub Action** — add Phase2S to any workflow with `uses: scanton/phase2s@v1`. No install step, no setup — it auto-installs `@scanton/phase2s` at runtime, runs your skill, and surfaces results three ways: `result` + `verdict` outputs, a GitHub Step Summary, and a PR comment (when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set on `pull_request` events).
- **Skill routing** — the `skill:` input accepts any Phase2S skill name with or without a leading `/` (`review`, `/adversarial`, etc.). Optional `args:` are appended to the prompt.
- **Multi-provider** — `provider:` accepts `anthropic` (default), `openai-api`, or `ollama`. Pass your key as a secret via `anthropic-api-key:` or `openai-api-key:`.
- **Verdict extraction** — for `/adversarial` (and any skill that emits `VERDICT: APPROVED|CHALLENGED|NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`), the `verdict` output is set automatically. Use it in downstream `if:` conditions.
- **`fail-on` control** — `error` (default) fails on non-zero exit; `challenged` also fails when verdict is `CHALLENGED`; `never` always passes (useful for advisory runs).
- **PR comments** — set `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` and the action posts the full skill output as a PR comment. Long outputs (>60k chars) are truncated with a pointer to the Step Summary.
- **Floating `v1` tag** — `uses: scanton/phase2s@v1` always points to the latest v0.x release. Updated automatically on every publish.

### Example

```yaml
- uses: scanton/phase2s@v1
  with:
    skill: adversarial
    args: "Evaluate the plan in PLAN.md"
    provider: anthropic
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    fail-on: challenged
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### For contributors

- **`src/action/index.ts`** — new file. JS action entry point: credential validation, `npm install -g @scanton/phase2s`, skill execution, verdict extraction, Step Summary, PR comment, fail-on logic. Exported `run()` for testability.
- **`action.yml`** — new file. `using: node20`, `main: dist/action/index.js`. Defines `skill`, `args`, `provider`, `anthropic-api-key`, `openai-api-key`, `fail-on` inputs and `result`, `verdict` outputs.
- **`package.json`** — `build:action` script (`ncc build src/action/index.ts -o dist/action`). `@actions/core`, `@actions/exec`, `@actions/github`, `@vercel/ncc` added as devDependencies. `!dist/action/` excluded from npm package files.
- **`tsconfig.json`** — `src/action` excluded so tsc doesn't emit a broken stub into `dist/action/`.
- **`.gitignore`** — `!dist/action/` un-ignores the ncc bundle so GitHub can run the action from the committed artifact.
- **`.github/workflows/build-action.yml`** — new CI workflow: verifies `dist/action/index.js` is committed and up-to-date on any PR touching `src/action/**`.
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — builds action bundle and force-pushes the floating `v1` tag after every npm publish.
- **365 tests** (up from 341). New: +24 action tests covering skill normalization, verdict extraction, fail-on logic, Step Summary, PR comments, env vars, auto-install, output truncation.

## v0.23.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 19: headless browser tool via Playwright.

### What you can do now

- **Browser tool** — a new `browser` tool powered by headless Chromium (via Playwright). Navigate to URLs, click elements, fill forms, take screenshots, and evaluate JavaScript in the page context. The `/qa` skill can now actually drive a running web app — not just inspect files.
- **Localhost first** — dev servers on `http://localhost:*` are the primary use case. `navigate` to your Next.js app, click a button, screenshot the result.
- **SSRF protection** — private IP ranges (RFC 1918: 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 192.168.x.x), link-local (169.254.x.x, AWS metadata), and non-HTTP schemes (chrome://, data://) are blocked. Only localhost and public internet addresses are allowed.
- **file:// sandboxed** — file:// URLs are allowed, but only for paths within the project directory (same sandbox as the existing file tools).
- **Screenshots to disk** — screenshots save to `.phase2s/screenshots/<timestamp>-<label>.png` and the tool returns both the file path and an 800×600 viewport thumbnail as base64 so the model can see what the page looks like.
- **Opt-in** — the browser tool is disabled by default (Playwright is ~170MB of Chromium). Enable in `.phase2s.yaml` with `browser: true`, or `PHASE2S_BROWSER=true` env var. If you enable it without Playwright installed, you get a clear error with install instructions.

### Setup

```bash
npm install -g playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

Then in `.phase2s.yaml`:
```yaml
browser: true
```

Or one-shot:
```bash
PHASE2S_BROWSER=true phase2s run "/qa test the login page"
```

### For contributors

- **`src/tools/browser.ts`** — new file. `createBrowserTool(cwd)` factory. `disposeBrowser()` exported for process cleanup. `getUrlBlockReason()` exported (used in tests). Single active-page model — each `navigate` closes the previous page before opening a new one.
- **`src/tools/index.ts`** — new `RegistryOptions` interface. `createDefaultRegistry()` accepts both the legacy boolean signature and the new options object (`{ allowDestructive, cwd, browserEnabled }`). Browser tool registered when `browserEnabled: true`.
- **`src/core/config.ts`** — new `browser?: boolean` field (default `false`). Reads `PHASE2S_BROWSER` env var.
- **`src/core/agent.ts`** — new `cwd?` field on `AgentOptions`. Passes `cwd` and `browserEnabled` to `createDefaultRegistry`.
- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — imports `disposeBrowser`. Calls it on SIGINT (before `process.exit`) and registers a `process.once("exit")` hook for normal exits.
- **341 tests** (up from 300). New: +10 browser tool tests (URL blocking, mocked playwright for all 7 actions, missing Playwright graceful error path).

## v0.22.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 18: shell completion, tool allow/deny docs, version path fix.

### What you can do now

- **Shell completion** — `phase2s completion bash` and `phase2s completion zsh` output completion scripts. Add `eval "$(phase2s completion bash)"` to `~/.bashrc` (or zsh equivalent) and `phase2s run "/exp<TAB>"` completes to `/explain`. Subcommand completion and `--json` / `--dry-run` flags included.
- **Tool allow/deny documented** — `tools:` and `deny:` in `.phase2s.yaml` have been live since Sprint 13 but were undocumented. Full reference and two "Common setups" examples added to `docs/configuration.md`: read-only agent (no `file_write` or `shell`) and no-shell agent (`deny: [shell]`).

### For contributors

- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — `completion <shell>` subcommand added. Outputs bash or zsh completion scripts that call `phase2s skills --json` dynamically so completions stay current as skills are added.
- **`docs/configuration.md`** — `tools:` and `deny:` fields added to the YAML reference. Two new Common setups examples.
- **320 tests** (up from 314). New: +6 completion tests.

## v0.21.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 17: Multi-turn skills via `{{ASK:}}` inline prompts. Skills can now embed questions directly in their prompt template body.

### What you can do now

- **`{{ASK:}}` in SKILL.md templates** — embed a question anywhere in your skill's prompt body: `{{ASK: What concern should I focus on?}}`. In the REPL, Phase2S pauses and asks before sending to the model. Multiple questions are asked sequentially. Duplicate questions (same text appearing twice) are asked once and the answer is reused.
- **Non-interactive safety** — `phase2s run` (one-shot), MCP tool calls, and non-TTY stdin all strip `{{ASK:}}` tokens automatically. One-shot and non-TTY warn to stderr. MCP surfaces a `PHASE2S_NOTE` in the tool result so Claude Code sees that interactive prompts were skipped.
- **`--version` permanently fixed** — reads from `package.json` at runtime by walking up from the current file. Works from source (vitest / ts-node) and compiled output. No more hardcoded constant that drifts on bumps.

### For contributors

- **`src/skills/template.ts`** — four new exports: `extractAskTokens()`, `substituteAskValues()`, `stripAskTokens()`, plus the `AskToken` interface. Grammar: `{{ASK: prompt text}}` ends at first `}}`, no nesting, leading/trailing whitespace trimmed, duplicates deduplicated.
- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — REPL path: extracts tokens, prompts user for each via readline, checks `process.stdin.isTTY` before entering the loop (non-TTY → strip + warn). One-shot path (`resolveSkillRouting`): strips tokens + warns to stderr.
- **`src/mcp/server.ts`** — `tools/call` strips `{{ASK:}}` tokens and adds a `PHASE2S_NOTE` content item to the result when tokens were present, so the MCP caller sees degradation explicitly.
- **314 tests** (up from 295). New: +13 template tests (`ask-tokens.test.ts`), +4 one-shot routing tests, +2 MCP degradation tests.

## v0.20.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 16: `phase2s skills --json`, clean install (no deprecation warnings), accurate test counts.

### What's new

- **`phase2s skills --json`** — machine-readable skill list: name, description, model tier, inputs with types. Pipe into `jq`, scripts, or anything else. `phase2s skills --json | jq '.[] | select(.model=="fast") | .name'` to list fast skills.
- **No more install warnings** — `npm install -g @scanton/phase2s` now runs clean. The `node-domexception` deprecation warning (from `openai` → `formdata-node`) is gone via an `overrides` entry forcing `formdata-node@^6`.
- **Accurate test counts** — vitest was discovering test files in `.claude/worktrees/` and reporting 861 tests instead of 291. Fixed by adding `vitest.config.ts` with explicit `include`/`exclude`. `npm test` now runs in ~1.3s instead of ~2.7s.
- **`/plan` saves to disk with timestamp** — plans are saved to `.phase2s/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<slug>.md` so multiple plans in a day don't collide. Path is reported after saving.
- **`--version` reads from `package.json` at runtime** — no more hardcoded version constant that gets out of sync on bumps.

### For contributors

- `vitest.config.ts` (new) — explicit include/exclude replaces vitest's default glob
- `package.json` — `overrides.formdata-node: ^6.0.0`; version `0.20.0`
- `src/cli/index.ts` — `skills` command gains `--json` option; `VERSION` now read from `package.json` via `createRequire`
- `.phase2s/skills/plan/SKILL.md` — updated plan file path format and instructions
- **295 tests** (up from 291). New: +4 `--json` serialisation tests.

## v0.19.1 — 2026-04-04

Patch: sync `VERSION` constant with `package.json` (was reporting 0.18.0 after v0.19.0 publish).

## v0.19.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 15 polish: `--dry-run` flag, typed input hints in REPL, model tier badges in skill list.

### What you can do now

- **`phase2s run --dry-run "/explain src/auth.ts"`** — preview which skill and model would be used without running anything. Useful when debugging `fast_model`/`smart_model` config. Shows "Would route to skill: explain (model: gpt-4o-mini)" or "No skill named 'X'. Would run as plain prompt."
- **Typed input hints in REPL** — when a skill asks you for an input, the prompt now shows the expected format inline. Boolean inputs show `(yes/no)`, enum inputs show `[low/medium/high]`. No more guessing valid values.
- **Model tier badges in skill list** — `phase2s skills` now shows `[fast]` or `[smart]` next to each skill name so you can see at a glance which model tier each skill uses. Skills without a declared tier show no badge.

### For contributors

- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — `run` command gains `--dry-run` option. Skills command gains tier badge display. REPL input prompting appends `typeHint` based on `SkillInput.type`.
- **291 tests** (up from 279). New: +12 tests for dry-run routing, tier badges, and typed input hints.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 15: Model tier dogfooding, one-shot skill routing, typed inputs v2.

### What you can do now

- **Model tier routing actually works** — 28 of 29 built-in skills now declare their model tier. Quick skills (`/explain`, `/diff`, `/checkpoint`, `/remember`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/skill`) run on `fast_model`. Deep skills (`/review`, `/satori`, `/debug`, `/investigate`, `/audit`, `/health`, `/qa`, `/tdd`, `/slop-clean`, `/plan`, `/plan-review`, `/scope-review`, `/deep-specify`, `/ship`, `/retro`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/docs`, `/adversarial`, `/consensus-plan`) run on `smart_model`. If you've configured `fast_model` and `smart_model` in `.phase2s.yaml`, this now actually does something.
- **One-shot skill routing** — `phase2s run "/explain src/auth.ts"` now routes through the explain skill and applies its model tier. Previously `phase2s run` treated everything as a plain prompt regardless of `/` prefix. REPL and one-shot mode now behave consistently. Routing is logged to stderr: `Routing to skill: explain (model: fast)`.
- **Typed MCP tool parameters** — Skills with `inputs:` can now declare `type: boolean | enum | number` on individual inputs. Claude Code presents boolean inputs as checkboxes, enum inputs as dropdowns, and number inputs as number fields. All values are stringified before template substitution. See [docs/writing-skills.md](docs/writing-skills.md).
- **glob upgraded to v13** — The `glob` package used for the file search tool has been upgraded from v11 (deprecated) to v13. No behavior changes.

### New SKILL.md frontmatter fields

```yaml
inputs:
  feature:
    prompt: "What feature are you planning?"
    type: string      # default, MCP: string field
  include_tests:
    prompt: "Include test tasks?"
    type: boolean     # MCP: boolean checkbox
  format:
    prompt: "Output format"
    type: enum
    enum: [prose, bullets, table]  # MCP: dropdown
  max_items:
    prompt: "Max items"
    type: number      # MCP: number field
```

### For contributors

- **`src/skills/types.ts`** — `SkillInput` gains optional `type?: "string" | "boolean" | "enum" | "number"` and `enum?: string[]`.
- **`src/skills/loader.ts`** — Parses `type:` and `enum:` from YAML inputs. Validates type values (unknown → warn + fallback to "string"). Coerces `enum: "string"` → `["string"]` (YAML parser edge case). Warns on invalid `model:` values that look like misspelled tiers.
- **`src/mcp/server.ts`** — `skillToTool()` emits typed JSON Schema: `boolean` → `{ type: "boolean" }`, `enum` → `{ type: "string", enum: [...] }`, `number` → `{ type: "number" }`. Input values are coerced to strings via `String()` before template substitution.
- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — New exported `resolveSkillRouting()` function detects `/skillname` prefix, looks up the skill, calls `substituteInputs()` (not a direct string replace), applies `modelOverride`. `oneShotMode()` delegates to it. Logs routing and unknown-skill warnings to stderr.
- **`package.json`** — `glob` updated from `^11.0.0` to `^13.0.0`.
- **279 tests** (up from 267). New: +6 loader tests (type/enum parsing and validation), +3 server tests (typed schema generation), +3 cli tests (one-shot routing).

## v0.17.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 14: Multi-provider support — Anthropic and Ollama.

### What you can do now

- **Run skills on Claude** — set `provider: anthropic` in `.phase2s.yaml` and every one of the 29 skills runs on Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or any Claude model you specify). Same `/adversarial`, `/satori`, `/consensus-plan` — now with Anthropic's API. Reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env automatically.
- **Run skills locally, free, private** — set `provider: ollama` and `model: qwen2.5-coder:7b` (or any model you have pulled) and the entire skill library runs on your machine. No API keys. Works offline. Free after the initial model pull.
- **Switch providers with one line** — the only change needed is `provider:` in `.phase2s.yaml`. No other config required.

### New config fields

- `provider: anthropic | ollama` — two new values alongside the existing `codex-cli` and `openai-api`
- `anthropicApiKey` — Anthropic API key (falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var)
- `anthropicMaxTokens` — max tokens for Anthropic responses (default `8192`)
- `ollamaBaseUrl` — Ollama server base URL (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`)
- Default models: `anthropic` → `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `ollama` → `llama3.1:8b`

### For contributors

- **`src/providers/anthropic.ts`** — New `AnthropicProvider` implementing `Provider`. Translates Anthropic streaming events (`content_block_delta`, `tool_use` blocks, `message_stop`) to the shared `ProviderEvent` format. Exports `translateMessages()` for direct testing — handles system message extraction, assistant tool-call turns, and consecutive tool-result folding into single synthetic user messages.
- **`src/providers/ollama.ts`** — `createOllamaProvider()` factory. Reuses `OpenAIProvider` with `baseURL` injection — Ollama's OpenAI-compatible API requires no new class.
- **`src/providers/index.ts`** — `createProvider()` extended for `"anthropic"` and `"ollama"` cases.
- **`src/core/config.ts`** — Provider enum extended to 4 values. New optional fields: `anthropicApiKey`, `anthropicMaxTokens`, `ollamaBaseUrl`. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var wired. `resolveDefaultModel()` returns correct defaults per provider.
- **267 tests** (up from 249). New: `test/providers/anthropic.test.ts` (12 tests), `test/providers/ollama.test.ts` (4 tests), +2 config tests.
- **Review hardening** (follow-up commit): stream error safety (`try/catch/finally` with `doneEmitted` guard), Anthropic preflight check in CLI, `anthropicMaxTokens` integer validation, `isLocalUrl()` SSRF warning for remote Ollama URLs, multi-system-message warning in `translateMessages()`.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 12: MCP hot-reload and session persistence.

### What you can do now

- **Skills hot-reload** — create a new skill with `/skill` during a Claude Code session and it becomes available as a Claude Code tool automatically, without restarting the MCP server. The server watches `.phase2s/skills/` for new entries and sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` to the client per MCP spec.
- **MCP session persistence** — multi-turn skills like `/satori` and `/consensus-plan` now maintain conversation history across multiple `tools/call` invocations in the same Claude Code session. Each skill gets its own `Conversation` that lives for the lifetime of the `phase2s mcp` subprocess. Previously every call started cold.

### For contributors

- **`src/mcp/server.ts`** — Added `MCPNotification` interface, `buildNotification()` helper, `setupSkillsWatcher()` (exported, tested in isolation). `handleRequest()` gains optional `sessionConversations?: Map<string, Conversation>` fourth parameter — backward-compatible. `initialize` response now includes `capabilities: { tools: { listChanged: true } }`. `runMCPServer()` creates the session map and wires the watcher.
- **`test/mcp/server.test.ts`** — Updated `MockAgent` to include `getConversation()`. 6 new tests: capabilities advertisement, `buildNotification` format, session map population, conversation reuse, per-skill isolation, stateless fallback.
- **`test/mcp/watcher.test.ts`** — New file. 4 tests for `setupSkillsWatcher`: watcher registration, debounced reload + notify, debounce coalescing, missing-directory error handling. Mocks `node:fs` in isolation.
- **220 tests total** (up from 209).

## v0.13.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 11: `/land-and-deploy` skill — push, PR, CI wait, merge.

### What you can do now

- **`/land-and-deploy`** — the missing link between `/ship` (commit) and production. Push the current branch, create or find the PR via `gh` CLI, wait for CI checks to pass, merge, delete the remote branch, and confirm the land. Handles the common failure paths cleanly: uncommitted changes, push conflicts, CI failures, merge conflicts — stops with a clear message at each, no silent failures, no force-push without instruction. Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated.

### For contributors

- **`.phase2s/skills/land-and-deploy/SKILL.md`** — new skill file. 7-step process covering state check, push, PR creation/discovery, CI wait, merge, and post-merge confirmation.
- **`test/skills/built-in-skills.test.ts`** — 3 new tests (name/triggers, prompt coverage, total count ≥ 29). **208 tests total** (up from 205).
- **`docs/skills.md`** — `/land-and-deploy` section added under Planning and shipping. Count updated to 29.
- **`docs/workflows.md`** — Step 5 (land-and-deploy) added to the "Starting a new feature" workflow.
- **`README.md`** — skill count updated to 29, `/land-and-deploy` added to highlights and roadmap.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 10: Persistent memory, meta-skill (/skill), session security hardening, and signal handler guard.

### What you can do now

- **Persistent memory** — Phase2S now remembers your project preferences, decisions, and lessons across sessions. On startup, it loads `.phase2s/memory/learnings.jsonl` and injects up to 2000 characters of learnings into the system prompt. The agent knows your project's conventions without you having to re-explain them every session.
- **`/remember`** — save a learning to memory with one command. Ask Phase2S to remember anything: "remember this: we use vitest not jest", "remember that the codex binary is at /opt/homebrew/bin/codex". Two follow-up questions (what to remember, what type), then it appends a JSON line to `.phase2s/memory/learnings.jsonl`. The next session picks it up automatically.
- **`/skill`** — create a new Phase2S skill from inside Phase2S. Three questions (what it does, what phrases trigger it, which model tier), then Phase2S writes the SKILL.md to `.phase2s/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. No manual YAML editing required. Phase2S can now extend itself.
- **Session file security** — session files (`.phase2s/sessions/*.json`) are now written with `mode: 0o600` (owner-read/write only). On shared or multi-user systems, conversation history is no longer world-readable. Both write paths (normal save after each turn + SIGINT emergency save) are fixed.

### For contributors

- **`src/core/memory.ts`** — new file. `loadLearnings(cwd)`: reads JSONL, skips invalid lines silently, returns `Learning[]`. `formatLearningsForPrompt(learnings)`: formats for system prompt injection, trims oldest first if over 2000 chars.
- **`src/utils/prompt.ts`** — `buildSystemPrompt()` gains optional `learnings?: string` third parameter. Appended after custom prompt if non-empty.
- **`src/core/agent.ts`** — `AgentOptions` gains `learnings?: string`. Passed to `buildSystemPrompt()` in constructor.
- **`src/core/conversation.ts`** — `save()` gains optional `mode?: number` parameter. Passed to `writeFile()` options when specified.
- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — `interactiveMode()` and `oneShotMode()` both call `loadLearnings(process.cwd())` and pass formatted string to `new Agent(...)`. Async save uses `mode: 0o600`. Sync SIGINT save uses `{ encoding: "utf-8", mode: 0o600 }`. VERSION bumped to `"0.12.0"`.
- **`src/providers/codex.ts`** — `_signalHandlersRegistered` guard flag wraps all three signal handler registrations (`exit`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`). Prevents `MaxListenersExceededWarning` when vitest re-evaluates the module across test files.
- **2 new SKILL.md files** — `.phase2s/skills/remember/SKILL.md`, `.phase2s/skills/skill/SKILL.md`.
- **5 new test files/sections** — `test/core/memory.test.ts` (9 tests), `test/utils/prompt.test.ts` (3 tests), built-in skills Sprint 10 section (5 tests), conversation persistence mode tests (2 tests), codex hardening guard test (1 test). **205 tests total** (up from 186).

### MCP backlog (deferred to Sprint 11)

- **MCP skills reload** — skills added mid-session via `/skill` aren't visible to Claude Code until restart. Future: `tools/reload` method.
- **MCP tool calls stateless** — each `tools/call` creates a fresh agent. Multi-turn MCP skills start cold every call. Future: per-session conversation persistence in MCP server.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 9: Claude Code MCP integration — Phase2S skills as Claude Code tools, `/adversarial` skill, and cross-model review.

### What you can do now

- **`phase2s mcp`** — start Phase2S as an MCP server. Claude Code spawns it automatically when `.claude/settings.json` is present in your project root. Every Phase2S skill becomes a `phase2s__<name>` Claude Code tool, loaded dynamically at startup. Add a SKILL.md, get a new tool. No code changes required.
- **`/adversarial`** — cross-model adversarial review designed for AI-to-AI invocation. Paste a plan or decision as input. Get back a structured verdict: `VERDICT: APPROVED | CHALLENGED | NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`, plus `STRONGEST_CONCERN`, `OBJECTIONS` (up to 3, specific and falsifiable), and `APPROVE_IF`. No interactive questions. Machine-readable output. When Claude Code (Claude, Anthropic) calls this via MCP, Phase2S (GPT-4o via Codex CLI) does the challenging. Different model, different training, no stake in agreeing.
- **Claude Code routing** — `CLAUDE.md` in the project root tells Claude Code when to invoke Phase2S tools automatically: adversarial review before significant plans, plan-review on engineering specs, health checks after sprints, etc.

### For contributors

- **`src/mcp/server.ts`** — new file. Exports `runMCPServer(cwd)`, `handleRequest(request, skills, cwd)` (testable without stdio), `skillToTool(skill)`, `toolNameToSkillName(toolName)`, and `MCP_SERVER_VERSION`. Uses same manual event-queue pattern as the CLI REPL to avoid the readline async iterator issue.
- **`src/cli/index.ts`** — `phase2s mcp` subcommand added. VERSION bumped to `"0.11.0"`.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — project-level MCP server config. `command: "phase2s", args: ["mcp"]`. No env vars.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — routing rules for Phase2S MCP tools added alongside existing gstack skill routing.
- **`.phase2s/skills/adversarial/SKILL.md`** — `model: smart`, no retries, no interactive steps. Output format enforced in prompt: VERDICT / STRONGEST_CONCERN / OBJECTIONS / APPROVE_IF.
- **11 new tests** — MCP server (7 in `test/mcp/server.test.ts`), adversarial skill (4 in `test/skills/built-in-skills.test.ts`). **186 tests total** (up from 175).

## v0.10.0 — 2026-04-04

Sprint 8: OMX Infrastructure — satori persistent execution loop, consensus-plan, agent tier routing (fast_model/smart_model), context snapshots, and underspecification gate.

### What you can do now

- **`/satori`** — persistent execution until verified complete. Runs a task, verifies with `npm test` (or `verifyCommand`), retries on failure (up to 3 times), injects failure context on each retry. Writes a context snapshot to `.phase2s/context/` before starting and a satori log to `.phase2s/satori/` after each attempt. Stops when tests are green.
- **`/consensus-plan`** — consensus-driven planning. Three sequential passes: Planner (concrete implementation plan), Architect (structural review, flags CONCERN/SUGGESTION), Critic (adversarial objections). Loops back to Planner with objections as constraints (max 3 loops). Outputs APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CHANGES / REVISE.
- **Agent tier routing** — skills (and callers) can now specify `model: fast` or `model: smart` in SKILL.md frontmatter. The agent resolves aliases to `config.fast_model` / `config.smart_model`, falling back to `config.model` if not configured. Set via `PHASE2S_FAST_MODEL` / `PHASE2S_SMART_MODEL` env vars or `.phase2s.yaml`.
- **Underspecification gate** — when `requireSpecification: true` in config, short prompts without file paths are rejected with a warning. Override with `force:` prefix.
- **Satori mode in agent** — `agent.run()` now accepts `maxRetries`, `verifyCommand`, `verifyFn` (for testing), `preRun`, and `postRun` options. The satori loop injects failure output back into the conversation and calls postRun after each attempt.

### For contributors

- **`src/core/agent.ts`** — full rewrite. `run()` now accepts `AgentRunOptions` (backward compatible: old `(message, onDelta)` signature still works). Inner `runOnce()` extracted so `addUser()` stays in the outer `run()` — satori retries inject new failure messages, not re-add the original user message. `verifyFn?` in options enables test injection without a real shell.
- **`src/core/config.ts`** — added `fast_model`, `smart_model`, `verifyCommand` (default: `"npm test"`), `requireSpecification` (default: `false`). Env vars: `PHASE2S_FAST_MODEL`, `PHASE2S_SMART_MODEL`, `PHASE2S_VERIFY_COMMAND`.
- **`src/providers/types.ts`** — `ChatStreamOptions` interface added. `chatStream()` now accepts optional third arg `options?: ChatStreamOptions` with `model?` field.
- **`src/providers/openai.ts`** and **`src/providers/codex.ts`** — updated to accept and pass through `options?.model`.
- **`src/skills/types.ts`** — `model?` and `retries?` fields added to `Skill` interface.
- **`src/skills/loader.ts`** — `model` and `retries` frontmatter fields parsed and attached to skill objects.
- **2 new SKILL.md files** in `.phase2s/skills/` — satori, consensus-plan.
- **18 new tests** — config Sprint 8 (4), loader Sprint 8 (3), agent satori loop (7), built-in skills Sprint 8 (4). **175 tests total** (up from 157).
- **`UNDERSPEC_WORD_THRESHOLD = 15`** — named constant, not a magic number.
- **VERSION** — fixed from stale `"0.7.0"` to `"0.10.0"`.

## v0.9.0 — 2026-04-03

Sprint 7: 5 execution skills — workflows for the actual work of writing, debugging, cleaning, and documenting code. Two ported from oh-my-codex (`/deep-specify` from `$deep-interview`, `/slop-clean` from `$ai-slop-cleaner`), three original.

### What you can do now

- **`/debug`** — systematic debugging end-to-end. Reproduce the bug, isolate the smallest failing case, form root cause hypotheses, implement the fix, verify with tests. Different from `/investigate` (which traces root cause only) — `/debug` goes all the way to a verified fix. Saves a debug log to `.phase2s/debug/`.
- **`/tdd`** — test-driven development. Red (write failing tests) → Green (minimal implementation) → Refactor (clean up). Detects your test framework from `package.json`. Accepts a target file or behavior description. Reports coverage delta.
- **`/slop-clean`** — anti-slop refactor pass, ported from oh-my-codex's `$ai-slop-cleaner`. Five-smell taxonomy: dead code, duplication, needless abstraction, boundary violations, missing tests. Runs on git-changed files or a specified path. Baseline tests before any changes. One smell category at a time. Tests after each pass.
- **`/deep-specify`** — structured spec interview before coding, ported from oh-my-codex's `$deep-interview`. Identifies the 3-5 highest-risk ambiguities, asks Socratic questions one at a time, synthesizes answers into a spec with Intent / Boundaries / Non-goals / Constraints / Success criteria. Saves to `.phase2s/specs/`. Gates at the end with a pointer to `/plan` or `/autoplan`.
- **`/docs`** — inline documentation generation. Writes JSDoc/TSDoc into the code itself (not an explanation to you). Priority: public API first (full `@param`/`@returns`/`@throws`/`@example`), then complex logic inline comments, then interface field annotations, then module headers. Runs `tsc --noEmit` after to catch annotation errors.

### For contributors

- **5 new SKILL.md files** in `.phase2s/skills/` — debug, tdd, clean, deep-specify, docs.
- **OMX adaptation strategy** — `/deep-specify` and `/slop-clean` are ported from oh-my-codex with two changes: (1) OMX infrastructure dependencies removed (no MCP state, no tmux workers, no `.omx/` paths), (2) paths remapped to `.phase2s/`. The smell taxonomy and Socratic question protocol are preserved intact.
- **Artifact directories** — new skills persist to `.phase2s/debug/` and `.phase2s/specs/` (consistent with existing `.phase2s/sessions/`, `.phase2s/checkpoints/`).
- **6 new tests** in `test/skills/built-in-skills.test.ts` — covers all 5 new skills (name, description, trigger phrases, prompt content checks) plus a sanity check that total loaded skill count is >= 23. **157 tests total** (up from 151).
- **OMX infrastructure backlog** — the power features from oh-my-codex that require Phase2S core changes (agent tier routing, `$ralph` persistent execution, `$ralplan` consensus planning, tmux teams, MCP state server, notification gateway) are documented in TODOS.md Long-term section for a future infrastructure sprint.

## v0.8.0 — 2026-04-03

Sprint 6: 11 new skills ported from gstack, stripped of YC marketing, renamed where startup connotations didn't fit.

### What you can do now

- **`/retro`** — weekly engineering retrospective. Runs `git log` across the last 7 days, reports velocity (commits, LOC, fix ratio, test ratio), identifies patterns and churn, ends with one concrete improvement to focus on next week. Saves to `.phase2s/retro/`.
- **`/health`** — code quality dashboard. Auto-detects your tooling (tsc, vitest/jest, eslint, knip). Runs each check, scores on a 0–10 weighted rubric (tests 40%, types 25%, lint 20%, dead code 15%). Shows trend across last N runs. Persists to `.phase2s/health/history.jsonl`. Reports only — does not fix.
- **`/audit`** — multi-phase security scan. Covers: secrets in code and git history, dependency vulnerabilities (`npm audit`), input validation and injection paths, sandbox enforcement review, shell command safety, and session/persistence security. Each finding includes severity (CRIT/HIGH/MED/LOW), confidence (VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED), and an exploit scenario.
- **`/plan-review`** — engineering plan review. Six sections: scope validation, architecture critique, code quality, test coverage map (ASCII diagram of which paths are tested vs. not), performance flags, and one adversarial outside challenge. Ends with APPROVE / APPROVE WITH CHANGES / REVISE AND RESUBMIT.
- **`/scope-review`** — scope and ambition challenge. Four modes: Expand (what's the 10x version?), Hold (max rigor on stated scope), Reduce (strip to essentials), Challenge (adversarial). Distinct from `/plan-review` which focuses on implementation quality vs. this which focuses on whether you're solving the right problem at the right scale.
- **`/autoplan`** — orchestrates `/scope-review` + `/plan-review` sequentially with defined auto-decision principles: prefer completeness, fix blast radius, cleaner architecture wins, eliminate duplication, explicit over clever, bias toward action. Surfaces only taste decisions and user challenges at the end gate.
- **`/checkpoint`** — structured session state snapshot. Infers current state from git and conversation: branch, recent commits, decisions made, remaining work, next step. Saves to `.phase2s/checkpoints/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`. Complements `--resume` (which restores the full conversation) with a human-readable summary.
- **`/careful`** — safety mode. Pauses before destructive shell commands (rm, git reset --hard, git push --force, DROP TABLE, docker rm, sudo) and asks for explicit confirmation. Safe commands (ls, git status, npm test) proceed without prompting.
- **`/freeze <dir>`** — restricts file edits to a single directory for the session. Ask the user which directory, then enforce it via model self-monitoring. Read operations unrestricted.
- **`/guard`** — combines `/careful` + `/freeze`. Full safety mode: destructive command confirmation AND directory-scoped edits. Single activation step.
- **`/unfreeze`** — clears the edit directory restriction set by `/freeze` or `/guard`.

### For contributors

- **11 new SKILL.md files** in `.phase2s/skills/` — retro, health, audit, plan-review, scope-review, autoplan, checkpoint, careful, freeze, guard, unfreeze. All follow the standard SKILL.md format (YAML frontmatter + prompt template).
- **Adaptation strategy** — skills are ported from gstack with two changes: (1) YC marketing content stripped (no Garry Tan persona, no YC application prompts, no garryslist.org essay links), (2) names with startup connotations renamed (cso → audit, plan-ceo-review → scope-review, plan-eng-review → plan-review).
- **Safety skills are prompt-only** — careful/freeze/guard/unfreeze enforce via model self-monitoring, not tool hooks. Phase2S's `allowDestructive: false` config provides shell-level enforcement underneath. This is documented as a soft constraint in each skill.
- **Artifact directories** — new skills persist to `.phase2s/retro/`, `.phase2s/health/`, `.phase2s/checkpoints/`, `.phase2s/security-reports/` (consistent with existing `.phase2s/sessions/`).
- **12 new tests** in `test/skills/built-in-skills.test.ts` — covers all 11 new skills (name, description, trigger phrases, prompt content) plus a sanity check that total loaded skill count is ≥ 18. **151 tests total** (up from 139).

## v0.7.0 — 2026-04-03

Sprint 5: security hardening, conversation persistence, and /diff skill.

### What you can do now

- **`phase2s --resume`** — picks up exactly where you left off. Every interactive turn is auto-saved to `.phase2s/sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`. Start a long debugging session, quit, come back the next day with `phase2s --resume` and the full conversation history is there.
- **`/diff` skill** — review uncommitted or last-commit changes with structured feedback. Say "what changed", "review this diff", or "check my diff". Gets you: what changed per file, why it probably changed, risk assessment, and test coverage gaps. Ends with a clear verdict (LOOKS GOOD / NEEDS REVIEW / RISKY).
- **Sandbox symlink fix** — `file_read` and `file_write` now use `realpath()` before the sandbox check. A symlink at `<project>/link -> /etc` would previously bypass the sandbox. Now it's blocked. Real files inside the project still work exactly as before.
- **Codex arg safety** — prompts starting with `--` are no longer misread by codex's own arg parser. The `"--"` end-of-flags separator is now inserted into the args array before the prompt.

### For contributors

- **`src/tools/sandbox.ts`** — new shared `assertInSandbox(filePath, cwd?)` helper. Uses `fs.realpath()` to follow symlinks before the sandbox check. Both `file-read` and `file-write` now call it instead of duplicating the `path.resolve()` check. ENOENT falls back to lexical resolve (safe for new files); other errors (dangling symlinks) block without leaking the absolute path.
- **`Conversation.save(path)` + `Conversation.load(path)`** — serialize/deserialize message history (including tool calls and tool results) to JSON. Parent directories are created automatically.
- **`AgentOptions.conversation?`** — inject an existing `Conversation` when constructing an `Agent`. Used by `--resume` to skip the fresh system prompt and load prior history. `agent.getConversation()` exposes the live conversation for post-run saves.
- **`cleanupTempDirs()` in codex.ts** — extracted into a named function, registered on `exit`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGINT`. Previously SIGTERM would bypass cleanup and leak prompt data in `/tmp`.
- **139 tests total** — 26 new tests: 22 across `test/tools/sandbox.test.ts`, `test/core/conversation-persistence.test.ts`, `test/skills/diff-skill.test.ts`, and `test/providers/codex-hardening.test.ts`, plus 4 more added during adversarial review hardening (parent-symlink attack, session prompt injection, role validation, message object validation). All 113 existing tests continue to pass.

---

## v0.6.0 — 2026-04-03

Sprint 4: streaming output and npm publish.

### What you can do now

- **Responses stream in real time** — words appear in your terminal as the model thinks. No spinner. No wait. Works in both the interactive REPL and `phase2s run "..."` one-shot mode. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PHASE2S_PROVIDER=openai-api` to see it.
- **`PHASE2S_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=true` env var** — unlock destructive shell commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, etc.) without a `.phase2s.yaml` file. Useful for scripted or automated use cases where you control the environment.
- **`npm install -g phase2s` is ready** — bin entry verified, `files` field set for a clean 36.5kB tarball. Publish workflow fires automatically on `git tag v0.6.0 && git push origin v0.6.0` once `NPM_TOKEN` is set in repo secrets.

### For contributors

- **Breaking interface change: `chat()` → `chatStream()`** — `Provider` now requires `chatStream(): AsyncIterable<ProviderEvent>`. Both providers updated. Old `chat()` is gone.
- **OpenAI streaming** — `chatStream()` uses `stream: true`. Tool call argument fragments accumulate per-index across chunks before emitting a `tool_calls` event. See `src/providers/openai.ts` for the accumulation logic.
- **Codex passthrough wrapper** — `chatStream()` wraps private `_chat()` in a single-event generator. Same batch UX as before, new interface. Real Codex JSONL streaming deferred.
- **`onDelta?: (text: string) => void` callback on `Agent.run()`** — fires with each text chunk. The CLI uses it to stream to stdout; skills call `run()` without it for batch semantics.
- **Test migration** — all 8 agent integration tests migrated from non-streaming stubs to `makeStreamingFakeClient`. 6 new tests added (delta ordering, fragment accumulation, event sequence, Codex wrapper, env var truthy variants). 113 tests total.
- **GitHub Actions publish workflow** — `.github/workflows/publish.yml` triggers on `v*` tag push, runs `npm test` before build. Requires `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret.
- **Post-review hardening** — `ora` removed from production deps (was unused after streaming); sparse `toolCallAccum` guard added (non-contiguous tool call indices from OpenAI are now filtered before emitting); `PHASE2S_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` now accepts `"1"` and `"yes"` in addition to `"true"`.

---

## v0.5.0 — 2026-04-03

Sprint 3: integration tests, shell hardening, and live API verification.

### What you can do now

- **`openai-api` provider works** — run `PHASE2S_PROVIDER=openai-api phase2s run "..."` with your OpenAI key and get real tool-calling responses. The full loop (user → LLM → tool call → execute → final answer) has been tested live against the API.
- **Shell safety on by default** — destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`, `git push --force`, etc.) are blocked unless you explicitly set `allowDestructive: true` in `.phase2s.yaml`. Safe to share configs with your team without accidentally blowing up something.
- **Truncation handling** — if the LLM hits its context limit mid-response, you get the partial text back with a clear `[Note: response was truncated]` notice instead of silence. Content-filtered responses return `[Response blocked by content filter]`.

### For contributors

- **8 agent integration tests** in `test/core/agent.test.ts` — covers no-tool-call, single tool call, multi-turn, tool error recovery, max turns sentinel, finish_reason length, finish_reason content_filter, and malformed JSON arguments. 107 tests total.
- **`OpenAIClientLike` interface** exported from `src/providers/openai.ts` — typed DI stub for tests, no real API key needed in CI.
- **`AgentOptions.provider?: Provider`** — inject a pre-constructed provider in tests without touching config.
- **`createShellTool(allowDestructive)` factory** in `src/tools/shell.ts` — backward-compat `shellTool` export unchanged, all 10 existing non-destructive shell tests unaffected.
- **`allowDestructive: boolean` (default `false`)** added to config schema in `src/core/config.ts`.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-04-03

Sprint 2: test coverage expansion, CI, and the `/explain` skill.

### For contributors

- Test suite grows from 56 to 96 tests across 10 test files
- **New: `test/tools/glob.test.ts`** — 9 tests: pattern matching, recursive `**` globs, `cwd` sandbox enforcement, custom ignore, node_modules default ignore
- **New: `test/tools/grep.test.ts`** — 8 tests: case-insensitive search, `filePattern` filtering, `maxResults` truncation, sandbox enforcement
- **New: `test/core/registry.test.ts`** — 9 tests: all `ToolRegistry` methods plus all three error paths in `execute()` (unknown tool, invalid args, thrown error)
- **New: `test/skills/loader.test.ts`** — 10 tests: flat `.md` files, directory-based `SKILL.md`, YAML array triggers, malformed frontmatter, README skip, missing dirs, `sourcePath`, deduplication
- **CI: `.github/workflows/test.yml`** — `npm test` runs on every push and pull request, Node.js 22, `npm ci`

### Added

- **`/explain` skill** — ask Phase2S to explain any piece of code or concept in plain language. Say "explain this", "what does this do", or "walk me through this" and it breaks it down clearly, following the code top-to-bottom and explaining intent, not just mechanics.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-03

Test suite, security hardening, and tool behavior improvements.

### For contributors

- `npm test` now works — 54 unit tests across tools and core modules (vitest)
- Tests cover: `file_read`, `file_write`, `shell`, `Conversation`, `loadConfig`
- Tests are deterministic on any machine (temp dir isolation, `HOME` override)

### Security fixes

- **File sandbox enforced** — `file_read` and `file_write` now reject any path outside the project directory. The LLM can no longer read `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or write outside your repo.
- **Truncation guard** — `file_write` refuses to overwrite an existing file with empty content. Prevents silent data loss from an LLM that sends an empty string.
- **Error sanitization** — `file_read` and `file_write` strip absolute filesystem paths from error messages before returning them to the LLM.
- **YAML config errors surface** — a malformed `.phase2s.yaml` now shows you the parse error instead of silently ignoring it and using defaults.

### Bug fixes

- **Context trim was dropping tool results but leaving their paired assistant `tool_calls` references** — this would cause an OpenAI API 400 error on the next turn. Now the entire turn (assistant message + all its tool results) is dropped atomically.
- **Codex temp dir cleanup was dead code** — the exit handler was calling `Set.delete` instead of `rmSync`. Temp dirs now actually get removed when the process exits or crashes.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-03

Added 5 built-in skills, fixed skill loader, added startup safety check.

### What you can do now

- Invoke `/review`, `/investigate`, `/plan`, `/ship`, `/qa` directly from the REPL
- Pass file arguments: `/review src/core/agent.ts` focuses Codex on a specific file
- Skills auto-load from `~/.codex/skills/` — Codex CLI skills work in Phase2S without any extra config
- Startup check: clear install instructions if `codex` isn't found, instead of a cryptic error

### Fixes

- SKILL.md frontmatter now parsed with the `yaml` library (arrays, multi-line values, quoted strings all work)
- `~/.codex/skills/` added to the skill search path with name deduplication (project skills win)

## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-03

First working release of Phase2S.

### What you can do now

- Run `phase2s` to open an interactive REPL powered by OpenAI Codex
- Use `phase2s run "..."` for one-shot prompts
- Invoke 5 built-in skills: `/review`, `/investigate`, `/plan`, `/ship`, `/qa`
- Pass file arguments to skills: `/review src/core/agent.ts`
- Drop a SKILL.md in `.phase2s/skills/` and it becomes a `/command` instantly
- Skills auto-load from `~/.codex/skills/` — anything you've written for Codex CLI works here too

### Provider

Codex CLI provider (`codex exec --json --full-auto`). Non-interactive, terminal-safe — codex never touches `/dev/tty`, so the REPL stays alive across multiple turns.

Model is auto-detected from `~/.codex/config.toml`. No need to configure twice.

### Under the hood

- SKILL.md frontmatter parsed with the `yaml` library — supports arrays, multi-line values, quoted strings
- Startup check: if `codex` isn't on PATH, you get a clear install message instead of a cryptic error
- REPL uses a manual event queue (not readline's async iterator, which has a known issue with event loop draining between turns)
