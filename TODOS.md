# Phase2S — TODO List

> **North star:** Phase2S is to Codex CLI what gstack is to Claude Code.
> A personal AI programming harness with a skill system, multi-model support,
> and enough structure to grow into a team-sized tool.

## Sprint 13 (current) — Interactive Skills + Plan Output + Tool Control (v0.16.0)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Version | v0.16.0 |
| Skills | 29 (updated templates) |
| Tests | ~240 |

### Multi-turn skills — skill inputs protocol

Skills can now declare structured inputs in SKILL.md frontmatter. In REPL mode, Phase2S prompts the user for each input before running. In MCP mode, inputs become typed tool parameters (Claude Code fills them in before calling the tool).

**SKILL.md frontmatter addition:**
```yaml
inputs:
  feature:
    prompt: "What feature do you want to plan?"
  scope:
    prompt: "Any scope constraints or non-goals?"
```

**Body uses normal placeholders:** `Plan the {{feature}} feature. Constraints: {{scope}}.`

- [ ] `src/skills/loader.ts` — add `inputs?: Record<string, { prompt: string }>` to `Skill` type; parse from YAML
- [ ] `src/cli/index.ts` — before running a skill in REPL/one-shot mode, extract unfilled `{{...}}` placeholders, look up prompt from `skill.inputs`, prompt user for each, inject answers
- [ ] `src/mcp/server.ts` — use `skill.inputs[name].prompt` as the parameter description in tool schema
- [ ] Tests: loader parses inputs, CLI prompts for missing inputs, MCP schema uses input descriptions (target: +10 tests)
- [ ] Update `/deep-specify` and `/plan` SKILL.md to use `inputs:` (dogfood the protocol)

### `/plan` skill improvement

- [ ] Rewrite `.phase2s/skills/plan/SKILL.md` — structured output: `## Goal`, `## Tasks` (checkboxes), `## Non-goals`, `## Risks`
- [ ] Tell the model to write the plan to `.phase2s/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md` via `file_write` tool
- [ ] Offer at the end: "Append tasks to TODOS.md? (yes/no)" — uses `{{ASK: Append tasks to TODOS.md?}}` or skill inputs

### Configurable tool allow/deny list

- [ ] `src/core/config.ts` — add `tools?: string[]` and `deny?: string[]` to `Phase2SConfig` schema; validate in `loadConfig()`
- [ ] `src/tools/registry.ts` — add `filter(allow?: string[], deny?: string[])` method; returns new registry with filtered tools
- [ ] `src/core/agent.ts` — apply `registry.filter(config.tools, config.deny)` before passing tools to provider
- [ ] Tests: config parses tools/deny, registry filters allow-list, registry filters deny-list, combined allow+deny, agent uses filtered list (target: +8 tests)
- [ ] Docs: add `tools:` / `deny:` example to `.phase2s.yaml` in `docs/configuration.md`

---

## Sprint 12 (done) — MCP Hot-Reload + Session Persistence (v0.15.0)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Version | v0.15.0 |
| Skills | 29 |
| Tests | 221 |

- [x] **MCP skills hot-reload** — `fs.watch()` on `.phase2s/skills/` with 80ms debounce. Sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` when new skills are added during a session. `capabilities: { tools: { listChanged: true } }` in initialize response.
- [x] **MCP session persistence** — `Map<string, Conversation>` keyed by skill name, scoped to MCP subprocess. Multi-turn skills (`/satori`, `/consensus-plan`) now maintain conversation history across calls within the same Claude Code session.
- [x] **`/review` adversarial extension** — After delivering standard review, offers opt-in adversarial challenge (VERDICT / STRONGEST_CONCERN / OBJECTIONS / APPROVE_IF). Fast path unchanged; adversarial is opt-in.

---

## Sprint 11 (done) — npm Publish + Bundled Skills (v0.13.x–v0.14.0)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Version | v0.14.0 |
| Skills | 29 |
| Tests | 221 |

- [x] **`/land-and-deploy` skill** — 7-step workflow: check state, push, open/discover PR via `gh`, wait for CI (`gh pr checks --watch`), merge + delete branch, post-merge confirmation.
- [x] **npm publish** — Published as `@scanton/phase2s` (unscoped `phase2s` blocked by npm similarity check). Token: Granular Access Token with 2FA bypass. Workflow triggers on `v*` tags.
- [x] **Bundled skills** — Added `bundledSkillsDir()` using `import.meta.url` in `loader.ts` so skills ship inside the npm package. Added `.phase2s/` to `package.json` files array.
- [x] **Renamed to `@scanton/phase2s`** — All docs, install commands updated.

---

## Sprint 10 (done) — Memory, Meta-Skill, Security Hardening (v0.12.0)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Version | v0.12.0 |
| Skills | 28 |
| Tests | 205 |

- [x] **Session file security** — `Conversation.save()` accepts `mode?: number`. CLI passes `mode: 0o600` on both async save path (after each turn) and sync SIGINT path (`writeFileSync`). Session files now owner-only by default.
- [x] **Signal handler guard** — `_signalHandlersRegistered` flag in `codex.ts` prevents double-registration if the module is evaluated multiple times in vitest. Eliminates `MaxListenersExceededWarning` as test suite grows.
- [x] **Memory system** — `src/core/memory.ts`: `loadLearnings(cwd)` reads `.phase2s/memory/learnings.jsonl`, `formatLearningsForPrompt()` formats them for system prompt injection (capped at ~2000 chars, trims oldest first). `buildSystemPrompt()` accepts `learnings?: string`. `AgentOptions` gains `learnings?: string`. CLI loads and passes learnings in `interactiveMode()` and `oneShotMode()`.
- [x] **`/remember` skill** — saves a project learning to `.phase2s/memory/learnings.jsonl` via shell append. Asks what to remember and what type (preference, decision, pattern, constraint, tool). Writes one JSON line.
- [x] **`/skill` meta-skill** — guided interview (3 questions) → generates a SKILL.md file via file-write. Creates `.phase2s/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Phase2S can now create new skills from within a session.
- [x] Tests: memory system (9 in `test/core/memory.test.ts`), prompt learnings injection (3 in `test/utils/prompt.test.ts`), /remember + /skill skills (5 in built-in-skills.test.ts), session file mode (2 in conversation-persistence.test.ts), signal handler guard (1 in codex-hardening.test.ts). **205 tests total** (up from 186).

### MCP backlog (discovered in Sprint 9, deferred)

- [x] **MCP skills reload** — Done in Sprint 12 (v0.15.0). `fs.watch()` + `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
- [x] **MCP tool calls stateless** — Done in Sprint 12 (v0.15.0). `Map<string, Conversation>` per-session persistence.

---

## Sprint 9 (done) — Claude Code MCP Integration (v0.11.0)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Version | v0.11.0 |
| Skills | 26 |
| Tests | 186 |

- [x] **`/adversarial` skill** — cross-model adversarial review with structured output (`VERDICT / STRONGEST_CONCERN / OBJECTIONS / APPROVE_IF`). `model: smart`. No interactive questions — designed for AI-to-AI invocation.
- [x] **MCP server** (`src/mcp/server.ts`) — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. Handles `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. Dynamic tool generation: every SKILL.md becomes a `phase2s__<name>` Claude Code tool at startup.
- [x] **`phase2s mcp` command** — added to `src/cli/index.ts`. Spawns the MCP server in the current working directory.
- [x] **`.claude/settings.json`** — project-level MCP config. No API key, no env vars. Claude Code spawns `phase2s mcp` automatically.
- [x] **`CLAUDE.md`** — routing rules telling Claude Code when to invoke Phase2S tools (adversarial review before plan execution, plan-review, scope-review, health, retro).
- [x] Tests: MCP server protocol (5), adversarial skill (4 in built-in-skills.test.ts + 2 helper tests). 186 tests total.

---

## Sprint 8 (done) — OMX Infrastructure (v0.10.0)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Version | v0.10.0 |
| Skills | 25 |
| Tests | 175 |

- [x] **Agent tier routing** — `fast_model` / `smart_model` config fields + `PHASE2S_FAST_MODEL` / `PHASE2S_SMART_MODEL` env vars. `model: fast` / `model: smart` in SKILL.md frontmatter resolved via `Agent.resolveModel()`.
- [x] **Persistent execution loop (satori)** — `agent.run()` accepts `maxRetries`, `verifyFn`, `preRun`, `postRun`. Satori loop injects failure context on retry. `addUser()` stays in outer `run()` — inner `runOnce()` does not re-add the user message.
- [x] **`/satori` skill** — SKILL.md with `retries: 3`, `model: smart`. Triggers: "satori", "run until tests pass", etc.
- [x] **Consensus planning** — `/consensus-plan` skill with Planner/Architect/Critic passes. APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CHANGES / REVISE output.
- [x] **Context snapshots** — `writeContextSnapshot()` in CLI writes git state + task to `.phase2s/context/` before satori runs.
- [x] **Underspecification gate** — `isUnderspecified()` with `UNDERSPEC_WORD_THRESHOLD = 15`. Gated by `requireSpecification: true` in config. Override with `force:` prefix.
- [x] **Satori log** — `writeSatoriLog()` writes `.phase2s/satori/<slug>.json` after each attempt with attempt count, pass/fail, failure lines.
- [x] Tests: config Sprint 8 (4), loader Sprint 8 (3), agent satori loop (7), built-in skills Sprint 8 (4). 175 tests total.

### OMX Infrastructure backlog (not yet implemented)

- [ ] **MCP state server** — shared state across agent turns via MCP protocol
- [ ] **Parallel teams** — multiple agents working in parallel on subtasks (tmux-style workers)
- [ ] **Notification gateway** — post-task notifications (Slack, email, webhook)
- [x] **`/skill` meta-skill** — done in Sprint 10. Guided interview creates SKILL.md files from within a session.

---

## Sprint 7 (done) — Execution Skills (5 new skills)

Ported from oh-my-codex (`$deep-interview` → `/deep-specify`, `$ai-slop-cleaner` → `/slop-clean`). Added original execution workflows for debug and TDD. Added documentation generation.

- [x] `/debug` — systematic debugging: reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → fix → verify. Saves logs to `.phase2s/debug/`.
- [x] `/tdd` — test-driven development: Red (failing tests) → Green (minimal impl) → Refactor. Reports coverage delta.
- [x] `/slop-clean` — anti-slop refactor pass: 5-smell taxonomy (dead code, duplication, needless abstraction, boundary violations, missing tests). One category at a time. Tests first.
- [x] `/deep-specify` — structured spec interview (ported from OMX `$deep-interview`): 3-5 Socratic questions, outputs Intent / Boundaries / Non-goals / Constraints / Success criteria to `.phase2s/specs/`.
- [x] `/docs` — inline documentation generation: JSDoc/TSDoc, type annotations, module headers. Documents git-changed files or a specified target.
- [x] Tests: `built-in-skills` Sprint 7 — 6 tests across all 5 new skills + total count sanity check (>=23). 157 tests total.

---

## Sprint 6 (done) — Skill Expansion (11 new skills)

- [x] `/retro` — weekly engineering retrospective: git commit analysis, velocity stats, one improvement focus
- [x] `/health` — code quality dashboard: runs tests, type check, lint; weighted score 0–10; persists history
- [x] `/audit` — security audit: secrets scan, dependency vulns, input validation, file sandbox, session security
- [x] `/plan-review` — engineering plan review: scope validation, architecture critique, test coverage map, perf analysis
- [x] `/checkpoint` — session state snapshot: infers git state + decisions, saves to `.phase2s/checkpoints/`
- [x] `/scope-review` — scope and ambition challenge: Expand / Hold / Reduce / Challenge modes
- [x] `/careful` — prompt-only safety mode: pauses before destructive shell commands, requires confirmation
- [x] `/freeze` — prompt-only edit restriction: limits file edits to a user-specified directory
- [x] `/guard` — combines careful + freeze: full safety mode
- [x] `/unfreeze` — clears the freeze/guard edit restriction
- [x] `/autoplan` — orchestrated review pipeline: runs scope-review + plan-review sequentially with auto-decision principles
- [x] Tests: `built-in-skills` — 12 tests across all 11 new skills + total count sanity check. 151 tests total.

## Sprint 2 (done) — Expand Coverage + CI + /explain

- [x] Tests: `glob` tool — pattern matching, recursive, sandbox, ignore (9 tests)
- [x] Tests: `grep` tool — case flag, filePattern, maxResults, sandbox (8 tests)
- [x] Tests: `skills/loader` — YAML frontmatter, deduplication, search paths (10 tests)
- [x] Tests: `ToolRegistry` — register, execute, list, toOpenAI(), throw recovery (9 tests)
- [x] Add CI (GitHub Actions on push) — `.github/workflows/test.yml`, Node.js 22
- [x] `/explain` skill — TDD: test first, then SKILL.md (5 tests, `{{target}}` placeholder)

## Sprint 1 (done) — Tests + Foundation

- [x] Set up vitest test framework (`npm test`)
- [x] Tests: `file_read` tool — sandbox, line ranges, error sanitization (11 tests)
- [x] Tests: `file_write` tool — sandbox, empty write guard, createDirs (8 tests)
- [x] Tests: `shell` tool — exit codes, timeout, cwd, schema validation (10 tests)
- [x] Tests: `Conversation` — token estimation, trimToTokenBudget, immutability (12 tests)
- [x] Tests: `loadConfig` — defaults, env var precedence, schema validation (10 tests)

---

## Sprint 5 (done) — Security Hardening + Persistence + /diff

- [x] **Sandbox `realpath()` fix** — extracted `src/tools/sandbox.ts` with `assertInSandbox()`. Both `file-read` and `file-write` now use `realpath()` before sandbox check. Symlinks inside project pointing outside cwd are blocked. v0.7.0.
- [x] **Codex arg injection hardening** — added `"--"` separator in args array before prompt in `codex.ts`. Prompts starting with `--` are no longer misread by codex's arg parser. Also added SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers for temp dir cleanup. v0.7.0.
- [x] **Conversation persistence** — `Conversation.save(path)` and `Conversation.load(path)` added. CLI auto-saves to `.phase2s/sessions/<date>.json` after each turn. `phase2s --resume` loads the most recent session. v0.7.0.
- [x] **`/diff` skill** — review uncommitted or last-commit changes with structured feedback. Triggers: "what changed", "review this diff", "check my diff". LOOKS GOOD / NEEDS REVIEW / RISKY verdict. v0.7.0.

---

## Sprint 4 (done) — Streaming + npm Publish

- [x] **`PHASE2S_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` env var** — `if (process.env.PHASE2S_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE === "true") envConfig.allowDestructive = true` added to `loadConfig()` in `src/core/config.ts`. v0.6.0.
- [x] **Streaming output** — `Provider.chat()` replaced by `chatStream(): AsyncIterable<ProviderEvent>`. OpenAI streams with `stream: true` + per-index tool call fragment accumulation. Codex passthrough wrapper. CLI streams via `onDelta?` callback on `Agent.run()`. v0.6.0.
- [x] **README polish for npm publish** — install-first user-facing README rewrite. v0.6.0.
- [x] **npm publish** — Published as `@scanton/phase2s` (unscoped `phase2s` blocked by npm similarity check against `phaser`). Token: Granular Access Token with 2FA bypass. Workflow: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` triggers on `v*` tags. Install: `npm install -g @scanton/phase2s`. v0.13.1.

---

## Near-term (v0.3.0) — OpenAI Provider + Polish

- [x] **Complete openai-api provider** — wire tool calling end-to-end ← done Sprint 3
  - Handle `finish_reason: "length"` and `"content_filter"` gracefully
  - Test with `file_read`, `shell`, and `glob` tools via direct API
- [ ] **Model-per-skill config** — `model: o3-mini` in SKILL.md frontmatter overrides default
  - Cheap model for fast skills (investigate, grep), smart model for complex ones (plan, review)
  - Deferred from Sprint 5 (no current consumers; implement when a skill actually needs it)
  - Future: consider model-tier config (`fast_model`, `smart_model` in `.phase2s.yaml`) instead of per-skill strings
- [x] **Codex arg injection hardening** — `"--"` separator added to args array before prompt. Done Sprint 5. v0.7.0.
- [x] **Shell tool hardening** — blocks destructive commands by default ← done Sprint 3
  - `allowDestructive: false` default; set `true` in `.phase2s.yaml` to unlock
- [x] **npm publish** — Done. See Sprint 4 section. Published as `@scanton/phase2s` at v0.13.1.

---

## Medium-term (v0.4.0–v0.5.0) — Power Features

- [x] **Streaming output** — done in Sprint 4 (v0.6.0). OpenAI streams; Codex passthrough wrapper. Real Codex JSONL streaming still deferred (format undocumented).
- [x] **Conversation persistence** — done Sprint 5. `Conversation.save/load`, `--resume` flag, auto-save after each turn. v0.7.0.
- [ ] **Multi-turn skills** — skills that ask follow-up questions mid-workflow
  - Today skills are static prompt templates; this makes them interactive
  - Protocol: `{{ASK: question}}` placeholder in SKILL.md that Phase2S intercepts and prompts the user before continuing
  - Required in both REPL mode (easy) and MCP mode (harder — needs round-trip)
- [ ] **`/plan` skill improvement** — output structured task list, not just prose
  - Write plan to `.phase2s/plans/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - Integration with TODOS.md (append generated tasks)
- [x] **`/diff` skill** — done Sprint 5. Structured diff review with LOOKS GOOD / NEEDS REVIEW / RISKY verdict. v0.7.0.
- [ ] **Configurable tool allow/deny list** — per-project `.phase2s.yaml`
  - `tools: [file_read, shell]` — only enable listed tools
  - `deny: [shell]` — disable specific tools
- [ ] **Real Codex JSONL streaming** — Codex outputs JSONL on stdout; format is undocumented. Spike needed before committing. Would make long `/satori` runs feel faster.
- [ ] **`glob` deprecation fix** — `glob@11.1.0` flagged as deprecated during npm install. Pinpoint which transitive dep pulls it in; update or pin to silence the warning.
- [ ] **Anthropic Claude provider** — add `src/providers/anthropic.ts` implementing the Provider interface using `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. Config: `provider: anthropic` in `.phase2s.yaml`. Removes hard OpenAI dependency; unlocks Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku as backends.

---

## Long-term (v1.0+) — Multi-model + Ecosystem

### OMX Infrastructure (from oh-my-codex analysis, Sprint 7 backlog)

These are the power features from oh-my-codex that go beyond SKILL.md. They require infrastructure changes to Phase2S's core.

- [ ] **Agent tier routing** — LOW/STANDARD/THOROUGH tiers mapped to `fast_model`/`smart_model` in `.phase2s.yaml`. Skills declare their tier; agent picks the right model automatically. Foundation for model-per-skill.
- [ ] **Persistent execution loop** (`$ralph` pattern) — iterate on a task until done + verified by a second agent pass. Requires stateful skill protocol (session hooks or MCP state). High value for long-running coding tasks.
- [ ] **Consensus planning** (`$ralplan` pattern) — Planner → Architect → Critic multi-agent consensus, up to 5 iterations until approved plan emerges. Requires multi-model routing infrastructure.
- [ ] **Parallel team execution** (`$team` pattern) — spawn N parallel Codex workers in git worktrees via tmux. Phase2S spawns and coordinates, collects outputs. High complexity but unlocks parallel agent work.
- [ ] **MCP state server** — implement `src/mcp/` state server with `state_write`/`state_read`/`state_clear`. Gives skills durable cross-turn state (like OMX's `.omx/state/` via MCP). Required by persistent execution and consensus planning.
- [ ] **Notification gateway** — Telegram/Discord webhooks for long-running team operations. Alerts when a parallel run completes or errors. OMX uses OpenClaw.
- [ ] **Context snapshots** — mandatory `.phase2s/context/{task-slug}-{ts}.md` before execution: task, outcome, constraints, unknowns, codebase touchpoints. Prevents silent partial completion.
- [x] **`/skill` meta-skill** — done in Sprint 10. Guided interview (3 questions) generates a SKILL.md file via file-write. Creates `.phase2s/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` from within a session.
- [ ] **Underspecification gate** — block requests below a confidence threshold and require `force:` prefix to bypass. OMX's `!` prefix / `force:` pattern.

### General

- [ ] **Multi-model routing** — use different models for different tasks
  - Config: `fast_model: gpt-4o-mini`, `smart_model: o3`, `code_model: codex`
  - Skills declare which tier they need; agent picks automatically
- [ ] **MCP server integration** — expose Phase2S tools as an MCP server
  - Any MCP client (Claude Desktop, other agents) can use phase2s tools
  - Inverse: consume external MCP servers as tools in the agent loop
- [ ] **oh-my-codex-style multi-agent** — route subtasks to specialized sub-agents
  - Orchestrator assigns tasks; specialist agents (coder, reviewer, tester) execute
  - Each specialist has its own tool set and system prompt
- [x] **Persistent memory across sessions** — done in Sprint 10. `loadLearnings()` + `formatLearningsForPrompt()` in `src/core/memory.ts`. Injected into system prompt via `AgentOptions.learnings`. CLI loads automatically from `.phase2s/memory/learnings.jsonl`. `/remember` skill writes new learnings.
- [ ] **Browser tool** — headless browser via Playwright for web research
  - Used by `/qa` skill (test sites), `/browse` skill (research), `/investigate` (docs lookup)
- [ ] **More provider support** — Anthropic Claude, local Ollama, Gemini
  - Provider interface already abstracted; just implement `chat()`
- [ ] **GitHub Actions integration** — run phase2s as a CI step
  - `/review` on every PR, `/qa` on every deploy, `/investigate` on test failures
- [ ] **VS Code extension** — run skills from the editor sidebar
  - `/review` on current file, `/investigate` on selected error, `/plan` for a feature

---

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

- `codex.ts`: prompt is passed as a CLI argument — arg injection risk if prompt contains `--flags` ← fixed in Sprint 5 (`"--"` separator)
- `shell.ts`: warns on destructive commands but doesn't block them ← fixed in Sprint 3
- `openai.ts`: doesn't handle `finish_reason: "length"` (silently drops truncated responses) ← fixed in Sprint 3
- `conversation.ts`: token estimation is ~4 chars/token — rough; use `tiktoken` for precision
- `file-read.ts`, `file-write.ts`: sandbox uses `resolve()` not `realpath()` — symlinks inside the project that point outside cwd bypass the sandbox. ← fixed in Sprint 5 (`assertInSandbox()` with `realpath()`)
- No integration tests (only unit tests so far) ← fixed in Sprint 3 (8 agent integration tests)
- CI added (GitHub Actions, Node.js 22) — no deploy step yet (CLI tool)
- `agent.ts`: provider display log showed "codex-cli" even when `PHASE2S_PROVIDER=openai-api` — fixed in Sprint 4 (now reads `this.provider.name`).

### INVESTIGATE (deferred from Sprint 5 adversarial review)

These were flagged but not fixed — they need deeper analysis before touching.

- **TOCTOU race in `assertInSandbox`** — There is a window between `assertInSandbox()` returning a resolved path and `writeFile(fullPath, ...)` actually writing. An attacker who can swap the file for a symlink in that window could redirect the write. Mitigating: the window is microseconds and requires local process control; fix would require `O_NOFOLLOW`-style atomic open, which Node.js `fs` doesn't expose directly. Worth a spike to see if `open(fd, O_WRONLY | O_NOFOLLOW)` via a native addon is feasible.
- **`SESSION_DIR` captured at module load** — `const SESSION_DIR = join(process.cwd(), ...)` in `cli/index.ts` runs when the module is imported, not when `main()` runs. If `cwd` changes before `main()` (unlikely in practice, but possible in programmatic use), the session path would be wrong. Fix: move to a lazy getter or compute inside `interactiveMode()`.
- ~~**Signal handler test side effects**~~ — Fixed in Sprint 10. `_signalHandlersRegistered` guard flag in `codex.ts` prevents duplicate handler registration if the module is evaluated multiple times.
- **`--full-auto` + poisoned session file threat model** — `phase2s --resume` injects arbitrary prior messages into the agent context. A crafted session file with plausible-looking assistant messages could influence the model to skip safety checks or run destructive commands under `--full-auto`. The role validation added in Sprint 5 blocks outright invalid roles, but a semantically poisoned (but structurally valid) session is not blocked. Threat model: only relevant if session files can be written by untrusted parties. Document the assumption that `.phase2s/sessions/` is user-private.
- **Prompt size cap before codex spawn** — No limit on prompt length before spawning codex. A very long conversation history passed via `--resume` could exceed codex's context limit, resulting in a cryptic spawn error. Fix: add a `conversation.trimToTokenBudget()` call before constructing the first codex prompt, or warn when `conversation.estimateTokens()` exceeds a threshold.
- ~~**Session files world-readable**~~ — Fixed in Sprint 10. `Conversation.save()` accepts `mode?: number`; CLI passes `0o600` on both async and sync write paths.

## Icebox (maybe never, but worth tracking)

- GUI / TUI mode — a terminal dashboard showing the agent loop in real-time
- Plugin system — third-party skills installable via npm
- Team mode — shared skill library + shared session history for a dev team
- Self-hosting — run phase2s as a web service with a REST API
